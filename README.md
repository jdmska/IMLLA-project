# IMLLA-project

The aim of the project was to compare models' performance on emotive texts written in American and British English.

The files include scraped posts from Facebook pages of Humans of New York and Humans of London in .csv and .json files, the code, and parameters of the three models.

The code is not flawless and needs some improvements. Unfortunately, the training does not seem to be carried out very well. It does, however, provide some results. Neither of the three models managed to correctly distinguish American from British English emotive texts. This may be due to the inadequate size or content of the dataset, or errors in the code.
