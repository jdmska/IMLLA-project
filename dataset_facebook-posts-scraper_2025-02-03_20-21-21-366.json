  "text": "\"I’m a sister, and Nurse-in-Charge, at the King’s College Hospital’s Children’s Critical Care Unit. We look after some of the most unwell kids in the country. I lead the team, support the junior staff, ensure plans are completed on time, and I attend ward rounds and bed meetings. As I’m deaf, I use the government’s Access to Work scheme to employ British Sign Language interpreters at team meetings and training courses. I have a specially-adapted stethoscope and other equipment that enables me to do this job as well as any hearing staff member. I also run a support network for other deaf and hard-of-hearing health care workers. We swap tips for coping at work and give each other emotional and practical support and encouragement.\n\n“The Equality Act 2010 states that employers must make ‘reasonable adjustments’ to ensure that workers with disabilities or physical or mental health conditions are not substantially disadvantaged when doing their jobs. My personal advice to employers is to get it right first time simply by talking to us. We are the ones living with the disability. Mistakes can happen, but if you are willing to face up to them, listen and make corrections, we’ll be able to do a great job, for you, your service and your clients.\n\n“The work is demanding - my shift begins at 7.30am and doesn’t finish until 8pm, sometimes later. You can’t do this job unless you’re totally committed. When I’m off work, I’ll make sure I unwind. I love to be outdoors, go hiking and travelling, and listening to music too. This sometimes surprises people - but I love RnB, especially 90s and Noughties, and a little bit of Reggae. No 2 deaf people are the same, and some will enjoy, or even play, music, while others have little or no interest in it. It has been especially tough during the Covid pandemic as the masks interfere with my lipreading people. But I get huge job satisfaction from getting the kids returned to their homes, and it’s just wonderful to see them back to their normal selves when they visit us to say ‘thank you!’”\n\nAsha, photographed by Stephen Iliffe for his Deaf Mosaic project.",

  "text": "“My train leaves in twenty minutes. I’m going on a silent meditation retreat for five days. For five days, you sit with your mind, and that’s all you’re doing. Think about it: how many times do you distract yourself during the day? There are the obvious things, like looking at your phone or watching TV. But then there’s just everyday life: walking around, taking in the world, talking to people. What if you stopped doing all that for five days? And you were alone with your mind? What happens?\n\nOur minds are wild. They just… function, like any other organ. They think, they create, they make stuff up. They don’t like uncertainty or loose ends, so they try to fill in the blanks: what happens next, what should I have done differently, am I OK? Then there are things from our past—tragedy, heartbreak, trauma. Things that didn’t feel good, so maybe we didn’t let ourselves feel them fully. We pushed them out of the way, buried them deeper, pretended they didn’t exist. But those feelings don’t disappear just because we want them to. They stay in our bodies. And when you sit still for several days, with no distractions, those feelings can resurface.\n\nSo why put yourself through it? Because when you sit with your mind long enough, there’s a certain liberation. You start to see it for what it is: ‘Oh, that’s just my mind.’ And there’s freedom in that. It creates space. You don’t have to get caught up in every thought. You can step back and say: ‘It’s real, but it’s not true.’ Those words were transformative for me.\n\nThe purpose of the practice isn’t a goal; it’s an orientation—to end suffering, not just for myself, but for all beings. That’s what guides me. It’s what led me to become a therapist. No one walks into a Buddhist center on a high note. You come in wrecked, like you were in a shipwreck and just crawled up onto the shore. But then, you find something. And you don’t want to keep it to yourself. You want to live by it.”",

  "text": "“Back in the eighties dungeons were becoming a thing in New York. Guys would pay a lot of money to come there and have some dominatrix tell them what to do. I was making leather pencil skirts for a lot of the doms, with holes in the back so that guys could kiss their ass. One day I was fitting a dom named Asia, and I told her: ‘I bet I could make more money than you without wearing stuff like this.’  She bet me I couldn’t.  It was all a big goof. But then I started really thinking about it. Asia was making $150 a session, and that was real money.  So I did the same thing I always do when I get an idea. I just ran an ad in the back of the Village Voice. Most of these girls were advertising how young they were. So I used the word ‘mature.’ And I figured out how to write ‘Jewish Guys Welcome’ in Yiddish, and I put that at the bottom. It was some of the easiest money I ever made. I never let them touch me. All I had to do was be a bossy black woman. And I could do that easy because my mother had been such a bitch. I’d pretend to be a school teacher, or a nanny. It was the dumbest shit. I just kept inventing crazy scenarios. And the crazier the scenario, the more money I made. One time I heard about a dom on the Upper East Side who charged $3,000 a week to kidnap a guy and lock him in her basement. I didn’t have a basement, but I knew a limo driver named Dean who liked to hustle like me. So every time I got a call from a new client, I’d say: ‘You want to be kidnapped, don’t you?’ And he’d start stuttering like: ‘Duh, duh, duh, duh.’  And I’d say: ‘Listen to me closely. Stand on the corner of 5th and 18th tomorrow at 3 pm. Don’t be late.’  Then I’d call Dean and tell him the plan. It was always easy to spot the guy. He’d be the one checking his watch and looking scared as shit. So we’d roll up in the limo, grab him by the collar, and pull him inside. Then I’d lock the doors and start telling him what to do. Everything went down in the back of the limo. Dean just rolled up the partition and kept his eyes on the road. At the end I’d give him $100, because I was getting $250 for that.”",

  "text": "“I’m teaching my last class in a few hours. I’ve been a professor of textile design for twenty-something years, but it’s sort of on an ‘as needed’ basis. And there’s been a decline in enrollment, so I don’t think I’m needed anymore. I’ll have to figure out what else to do with my time. I don’t want to just start binge-watching Netflix. I could always go work as a receptionist somewhere. But I’d like to think I have something particular to express, and that if I pour my energy into it, and I’m disciplined enough, then something will come out of it. But it takes bravery to be creative, right? You know, you look at Pinterest or whatever, and it looks like everything’s been done already. It’s easier to find the confidence when you’re 25, or 35, or even 45; you can kind of convince yourself that you're cool and hip and, you know, of the moment. If I was still in my thirties maybe I’d invest in going to art school or something. But at this age, it’s kind of like: is that really worth the investment? At an age where most people are thinking of retiring? It’s a question of time. Because how many more years do I have of actually working, creating? But also, it’s a self-worth question. If I do a two-year degree, I’m almost sixty. If I do a four-year degree, I’m definitely sixty. You worry about investing all that time, all that money, all that energy. And then kind of being mediocre, you know, at that thing. And that would be hard to swallow at this age, right? You kind of want to finish on top.”",

  "text": "\"I actually come from the East End, Stepney, so I'm a true blue Cockney. When I was 6 we were bombed-out during the war and moved to Burnt Oak, and I've lived here ever since. Dad always used to say to me. 'Whatever happens to you, rise above it and get on with it' and I do. I'm 86 but still very fit and active, although I don't overdo it. I have no children. I had a long-term partner but we didn't live together; he had his house and I had mine. He was going to buy us a house in the country but sadly he died before he got the chance. He really was lovely and we had 40 years. \n\n“I've always been very interested in local affairs and improving things. I'm used to organising and good at working things out, so if anyone has a problem I'll help them solve it. I don't have any authority, but I do know how to channel people in the right direction. For many years I also helped to look after my neighbour Rose. When she developed dementia she needed the extra help of a care home, but they always said that she perked right up when I went in. She died about 3 years ago, and her carers are now renting the house. They're from the Philippines and they're awfully sweet. The hubby keeps knocking and asking, 'Are you all right?' and I say, 'I'm fine, Sonny. I'm fine.' I battle on. I just think it's in my genes. My grandmother was an amazing woman who raised 8 children on her own in the East End after she was widowed young. She's always inspired me. It took me 15 years of no holidays, no this, no that, to buy my house, but I did it. So now I have security. I also rescue cats. I have 8 at the moment. They're always knocking on my door and asking, 'Can I come and live with you?' so I'll go, 'Okay, come on in'. Keeping busy keeps me young and means I don't have time to flag.” \n\nMary, met in Burnt Oak as part of the #BarnetTownCentreHeroes project. \n\n#agingwell #helpingothers #eastend #burntoak #goodneighbours #Indomitable  #catlover #keepingyoung #londonlife #humans",

  "text": "“Timidity. Timidity is the best word for it. I’d never had a girlfriend. And I couldn’t stand up for myself. Whenever someone spoke with a little more confidence than me, I’d just assume they were superior and back down. I still had a sense of self-worth. I’d get angry if people pushed me. But I could never direct it; it would turn into tears. There was just this intense dissatisfaction with my life and a feeling that I needed to change. Then one day I was walking through Harlem and I passed a dojo; inside there were these guys in full armor. They were hitting each other with blunted weapons. This wasn’t stage-fighting, it was full-contact. The sparks were flying: boom, boom, boom. I’ve always loved the Middle Ages, and I’d done some fencing in college—so I decided to give it a try. I was useless at first. The armor is a shock to your system. There’s this thing called helmet horrors, when your brain starts to tell you that you’re suffocating to death. So it took me awhile to learn to breathe. And of course I was way too timid. After one practice a Ukrainian guy started screaming in my face, saying I was useless. I started crying in front of everyone. Because I knew that he was telling the truth. I could have quit right then, but instead I made the decision to change. I stopped worrying about getting hit. I realized: I’m wearing steel armor, it’s not going to hurt me. I became more explosive. Our next match I actually took some people down. It’s the first time I felt like I contributed, and that started a sort of feedback loop. It’s not that I won every match. But I went into every match believing I had a chance to win. After the Carolina Carnage tournament our team captain sent a message to the entire group chat. I still have it on my phone. He said: ‘I want everyone to look at Marco. He has changed more than I’ve ever seen anyone change.’ It even spilled over to my normal life. I started standing up straighter, dressing better. When I first met my fiancé, there were all these roadblocks. All these mixed signals that I previously would have taken as rejection. But I was persistent. It’s like: ‘What’s the worst that can happen? I’ve been hit with an axe.’”",

  "text": "“I was angry with him for a long time, until super recently. It’s only been in the past two months or so that I’ve decided I haven’t been giving him enough love and respect. He came to America with no money, barely speaking English. He wasn’t able to attend school himself. He didn’t want me enduring those same hardships. He told me so many times growing up: ‘Everything I’m doing is for your good.’ But he was really strict. I don’t know how to better explain it: he told me what to do, and I had to do it. A lot of kids would hang out after school, go to the mall. I never had that social interaction. All I did was stay at home and study. Cello was a big reason for the rift that developed between us. My dad was my private teacher, and he started my lessons around the age of five. It quickly ramped up to multiple hours a day. It was really painful, but he made me practice so much that I became one of the best cello players in the country. I got into a great school. But as soon as my college acceptances arrived, I quit. Because I didn’t feel the need to do it anymore. Everything in my childhood, everything I did growing up, was purely to be put on a college application. Now that I’m in college I’m learning that there are a lot of other ways to live. I’ve been trying hard to talk to a lot of people. How we’re talking, right now? Two years ago, I’d never have been able to do this. But I’ve put a lot of effort into it. These past few months I’ve gotten really into raving. A lot of these big artists have super large Asian fan bases, so I feel that I can connect pretty easily. I’m not as loose as other people, because I go sober. But I’m trying to loosen up. Which for me, right now, involves putting my hand up and jumping around.”",

Helping these babies make their milestones; that is awesome for me: sounds, shapes, colors. Those things are very important. But you have to show some type of affection, right? You're with them for eight hours a day. If they come to a classroom and don’t feel love, they won’t want to be there. I’m always telling the children to give me love. And when I say to give me love, that means to give me a hug. So I hug the children a lot. One day a mother came to me, and she said that her child kept giving her hugs. She wanted to know where it was coming from. I told her it was coming from me.”",

I have some suitors, men who are interested in me, but I say no, because I'm scared. I don't want. I have my son.

When I was 17 I fell in love with a man who lived nearby and married him. We didn't plan to have kids but I fell pregnant by surprise and after my son was born I just loved him so much. I was with his father for 7 years and it was actually a very good relationship. But then one day he said 'Sorry, I have to leave because I'm seeing another girl.' At first I went 'What?! Why?!' Then I said 'OK, if you have to leave, go! I will be fine.' But I wasn't. After a couple of months he told me that he wanted to come back, but I said no because he broke my heart and the trust was gone.\n\n\"Then, 4 years ago, I fell in love again and a year later we married. We were studying accountancy together, we had the same political views and distrust of the police, he was funny and he had a very good relationship with my son and my family. We decided to move to London because Colombia is a bit too dangerous. Every day you worry that you might be shot - by the police, by gangs, by anyone - and I didn't feel it was safe for my son. But once we were here my husband started being violent to me. The first time he half-strangled me I was very surprised and very scared. Afterwards he apologised, told me he loved me, said it would never happen again, all of that. But the next time we argued he pulled the curtains down and threw the curtain rail at me, then he threw lots of other objects at me too. The third time, when he half-strangled me again, I'd had enough. As soon as he'd gone out, I packed up our things and I left with my son.\"\n\nPaula, met in Burgess Park, May 2019 (1/2)",

  "text": "“I’m 97, and my earliest memories are of London by the yellow light of gas lamps, the thrill of stream trains blasting out huge plumes of black smoke, outside toilets, and filling the bath with jugs of water heated over a coal-fired stove. Back then, deaf people didn’t have state benefits, hearing aids, equal rights, social workers, or sign language interpreters. I attended the Jewish School for the Deaf and Dumb in Balham, but it was an oral school and signs were not allowed. We could only sign when safely out of sight of the teachers. They had low expectations of us and we left school with no qualifications at all. We learnt sign language from classmates who also had deaf parents and secretly brought in their own ‘home signs’. The school didn’t drop ‘Dumb’ from its name until 1934. Of course, we’re not dumb at all. But this was 60 years before British Sign Language (BSL) was even thought of as a language in its own right, and most hearing people had no idea how rich our sign language was. \n\n“In 1950, I visited Paris and met a group of French deaf people. One of them, Ann, was originally from Poland and much of her family was murdered during the Holocaust. We fell in love, got married and were together for 55 years until she passed away in 2006. She was the love of my life and I still miss her and carry a small photo of her in my pocket.”\n\n“I live independently with my own apartment at a retirement home. Someone comes in to make my breakfast, help me wash and dress, and prepare my evening meal for later. My children are now 70 and 68 and they keep an eye out for me while I look after my own paperwork and bills. Aside from losing the sight in one eye and relying on a walking stick, I’m still in excellent health. I don’t smoke, I drink only in moderation at special occasions, and I keep my mind active by doing the crossword, playing Scrabble, and socialising twice-weekly at the Jewish Deaf Association (JDA) which supports deaf people of all ethnicities in Barnet. I may be nearly 100, but I'm proud to remain an active part of our deaf community.” \n\nMartin, photographed by Stephen Iliffe for his Deaf Mosaic project.",

If our neighbor was driving a Mercedes, I would not accept a Volkswagen. I won't eat no food, I won't go to school, until I get a Mercedes. I’m 31, right? Until now, I have literally destroyed-- four, five, six, seven-- eight cars. Eight cars in accidents, like you see in movies. Drifting and all that shit, I can do that in real life. But my family is very different than me. We come from the state in India where Gandhi was born. My parents are very religious; they’re Jain. These people believe that every organism in this world deserves to live. No eggs, no meat. My mom does not even eat onions. My father makes a lot of money; but he does not spend it. Just gathers, gathers, gathers. What is the point of that? Myself, I am a very materialist person. I love myself more than anybody else in this world. If I had a boat with my family, my friends, and I could only save one person, it will be myself. That’s how it's supposed to be for everybody. Because if I lost everything, I have the ability, I have the spirit in me, to get it back again, again, again. I lost like $3.5 million at a very early age, right? I don't care. I'll make it again. And when I’m making money, I will spend it. You see these Michael Kors, what do you call them: sneakers? I pay like $400, $500 for that. But I’m not showing off, I’m a Leo. And Leo isn’t ruled by a planet, it’s ruled by a star. The sun. The sun is the center of everything, so Leos need the best of everything. They do not want to dominate anybody. But when I walk in, people feel like I'm trying to be better than them. You would feel it yourself. Even if I don’t say anything, you would feel I’m arrogant. But I'm not arrogant. I'm a sweetheart.”",

White hair. She heard me saying that I didn’t have money to go on my senior trip. So she parked the bus, went into to the dean’s office, and said: ‘Here’s $80, let the girl go on the trip.’ I had a science teacher, Ms. Bernard. She knew that we were homeless, so every once in awhile she’d pay me $20 to clean her classroom. Just so that I could do something for my birthday, or get myself pizza one night, stuff like that. Then our dean Ms. V would let me bring home extra food from the cafeteria, which wasn’t allowed. If it wasn’t for the educators in my life, I’d have gone off the rails, the way a lot of kids who have trouble at home do. I was just craving attention so much. My mom, I love her. But she's never been the best mental health wise, especially after everything she's gone through. I was also getting bullied, just relentlessly by kids in my class. I learned pretty quick that people paid attention to me academically, no other way. In high school my science teachers were really where it was at. Dr. Khan, especially. He was my marine biology teacher. It was my favorite class, because I’ve always loved marine biology. But we also talked about music a lot. That year everything was really up in the air for me: I’d just transferred schools, I was taking care of my little brother, our stepdad was domestically violent. That Christmas Dr. Khan gave me a present. Two presents, actually. The first present was cookies. He said: ‘I always talk to my wife about you, so she made you cookies.’ His wife baked things for a living, on the side. So these were like, real cookies. With sea salt on top. Then the second present was a CD with all the songs we’d ever talked about, mixed-together with videos of all my favorite animals. I do not like dolphins. I love whales. And I genuinely have a thing for sharks. So there’d be like a Blink 182 song, paired with a video of a hammerhead shark. On the card he wrote: ‘Remember, you can always talk to me.”",

And I had to move out all this furniture that I’d connected to our home and our marriage. It wasn’t the best way for him to do it. He was going through some things; we were struggling financially. But yeah, it wasn’t the best way. It’s brought up some youthful trauma. I didn’t come from a nuclear family, so there’s some abandonment issues. And it’s like I’m feeling the sting of puberty all over again. Maybe if I was prettier, he’d still like me. Maybe if I could keep up with him athletically, he'd still like me. But it's only been three months. I don’t feel like there’s a stamp on it, not yet. No matter what the papers say. He’s still the love of my life. In my head I’m thinking: maybe this is a space of time where I can work on myself, and I’ll get him back. It’s hard to not reach out. But I’m being strategic. You know, showing him I'm a big girl. In the meantime I’m trying to fortify myself. I came up with that, by the way: ‘Fortify myself.’ I didn’t hear it on any podcast. I came up with that by doing my own trench work. I’m trying to hold myself accountable to the people I see every day, which is myself. And that’s the hardest person to be accountable to. Did I honor myself yesterday? Did I make plans for myself tomorrow? Can I still love myself in the present, even if right now I don’t look like the ideal version of myself? I have this app called Finch. It gives me goals, things like: get out of bed, wash your face, make a meaningful connection with someone. I’ve struggled with depression, still do probably. Last night was difficult. But I’ve managed to not fall into any self-destructive habits. Growing up as a teen, someone who is big boned, you collect all these self-destructive habits. And I haven't been self-destructive. I've being going to work. And I’m not crying. Aren’t you proud of me?  I’m not crying. Am I ready to be alone? That’s a deep question. I don’t want to wrestle with that demon, not yet. But in the meantime, fortifying myself. Fortify, fortify. Yeah.”",

  "text": "“My husband and I adopted him last November after a pretty gruelling vetting process that lasted about 2 years. When we first met him at his foster home he looked like someone in a burns unit - his eczema was so bad that he was covered with bleeding sores. But we liked him, we thought he was really sweet, and we could see him being right for us so we said we wanted to go ahead. Then we met his paediatrician who said ‘Look, this kid doesn’t have much going for him. He has a global delay of a year. He’s missed out on a great deal of learning. He can’t really talk. It may be that he’s autistic and has severe allergies. The worst case scenario is that he may never be able to live independently as an adult.’ We were astonished by this because, to us, he just seemed like a normal 3-year-old kid with a few problems. So we decided we’d still go ahead.\n\n“Friends who’ve also adopted said they cried every single day for the first 2 weeks because of the stress. With us it was all pretty smooth and we got the hang of it pretty quickly. He did have quite volatile mood swings but they weren’t unmanageable. We identified that he has 2 different kinds of tantrums. Sometimes he’ll allow himself to be soothed, he just needs a good cuddle and that will fix it. Other times he won’t let you touch him, he’ll just stand on the other side of the room and scream, and you’ve just got to ignore it and wait for it to pass. His speech has really come along and his eczema has all but disappeared. He is a bit behind because he hasn’t had the best start in life, but he’ll catch up. He’s started nursery and is loving it, and he’s altogether a really obliging little fellow. He goes to bed when he’s told. He sleeps all the way through the night. He eats pretty much everything. He plays nicely with other children. He’s very considerate. He shares. He’s also very good at entertaining himself, is always saying and doing funny things, and just loves getting the choo-choo or bus somewhere. We love him to bits and feel very lucky. Now we can’t really imagine him not being in our life. He brings us so much joy.”\n\nGareth, met with his son on Borough High Street (and phone-HoGLed after), in June 2019.",

It broke my heart. But I understood it was because they were stressed – mentally, emotionally, financially. So I just cry, let it out and let it go, and the next day, I can't even remember. It's gone. \n\n“One day someone told me 'You are too human!' How can someone be too human? How is that possible? I'm just a human being. That's all. I think we should all be like that. I'm not saying I'm the best person in the world. I do make mistakes. I do get angry. I might be too sensitive. But I try to get over it. I try to be the best person I can be. You keep going.\"\n\n“I stopped my nursing course in Portugal to look after my dad and my family after he had his stroke 16 years ago. Then I did care work for elderly people while I was studying here in London and working at McDonalds. I was born in Guinea-Bissau and brought up in Portugal, so English is my second language. I'm also very shy. But my confidence has grown so much since I've worked here. I open up to people more, because in this work you have to. Now I want to do a Business Degree and, if God gives me the life and resources, I would like to start an orphanage back in Guinea-Bissau to look after kids there too. \n\n“The strength of my parents is always inspiring me, particularly my dad who's never stopped, despite his stroke, and is still with us today. Sometimes you feel like 'I'm not well emotionally myself, I can't help'. But no, that's wrong. You can. I have my problems but I try to leave them at home. If I have bread and someone has none, I can give them half. Same thing with sharing love.”  \n\nNadia, one of Barnet's Town Centre Heroes, met at work in the Co-op in Crickelwood.",

  "text": "“I was born with Auditory Processing Disorder (APD). This means that while my ears work normally and I hear everything around me, my brain can’t process speech. So I don’t understand people's voices, and I can’t speak myself, which means British Sign Language (BSL) is my first and preferred language. I went to deaf school, my best friends are deaf, and I’ve always felt a part of the deaf community. I'm also proud to play for Welling United Deaf Football Club and the London Lions Deaf Basketball Team too.\"\n\n“I work as one of 6 baristas at this really cool coffee shop in Waterloo where we’re all deaf or hard-of-hearing. So when customers come in we gently encourage them to engage us on our terms and order their Cappuccino or Americano, or whatever else they choose, by signing to us in BSL. For those who don’t sign, that’s okay, as we have a video display at the shop counter which demonstrates the BSL signs for each of the drinks we serve. So our customers can not only enjoy a great Brazilian, Columbian or Indonesian coffee but also learn some useful signs and chat with us too. That’s why the café’s called ‘Dialogue’ – because we’re encouraging conversations between deaf and hearing people. Our management company has been running a similar Dialogue cafe in Istanbul, Turkey, for 8 years, which has been a huge success, and they have similar ambitions for our London café now. We also host exhibitions of art by talented deaf and disabled artists, and we have a programme of awareness-raising events that people can book onto. There’s always something happening at the café. We’re right next to Waterloo station, so it's really easy to reach us by train, tube or bus too. Please do come and visit us! Everyone is welcome here.”\n\nLandry, photographed at work in the café by Stephen Iliffe for his Deaf Mosaic project.\n\n#deaf #auditoryprocessingdisorder #BritishSignLanguage #barista #dialogue #communication #empowerment",

  "text": "(2/2) “But the therapy was also helping me dig down into my core values which I discovered are honesty, open-mindedness, equality and personal responsibility. So I decided to keep trying polyamory. I grew up in #Frestonia, this squatted area in West London which declared itself an independent country for about 8 years and was basically an anarchist community. And I was thinking ‘What’s with this Capitalist scarcity mindset, this focus on heterosexual monogamous relationships, and the idea that you can only have that kind of love with one person? Or that once you’re in a relationship you can’t make new friends of the opposite sex, because that might threaten it? Why?’ None of that makes any sense to me. I have more of an abundance mindset. There’s love everywhere. \n\n“Now I find polyamory gives me freedom and creativity and an abundance of joy. I love learning new things and meeting new people, so it’s perfect for me. I don’t go into a new relationship thinking ‘This is what I want or need from this person’. I’ve given myself security. I have a council flat I love and painted myself. I’ve got friends that I love. So anything that anyone else brings in has to be positive, although of course if one of them is sad or depressed I’ll listen and support them. I’m currently seeing 4 guys, even though my limit is normally 3 or things can get a bit chaotic! One, who’s a single dad to 2 daughters, is the first person I went on a polyamorous date with 5 years ago. Another’s a skater I’ve fancied since I was 14. People ask if I have a type, but they’re all really different. If I wanted the same thing, I’d just be with one person. It’s all about the connection and there’s a lot of love involved. Not intense love as in ‘I can’t live without you’, or ‘I want to marry you’, but a respect and a love of the person, the human that they are, and the fascination of being with them, all of them. I’m really delighted they’re all in my life. Once you let go of the expectations of what a ‘normal’ relationship looks like you find so much that you never knew you wanted in your life!” \n\nLucy, one of the ‘living subjects’ in Nova New Opportunities'  ‘School of Humanity’ in Ladbroke Grove.",

  "text": "(1/2) “I live on my own and don’t want to live with anyone else ever again. I’ve always struggled in monogamous relationships, since I was very young. I moved my first proper boyfriend into my parents’ house when I was 16, had a couple of relationships after that still living with my parents, then moved out with one for 6 years, living in a flat next to my parents’ house where I grew up. In between each relationship, I always had at least a year on my own, because I felt I had to get back to myself. All my relationships had an element of control and jealousy and it was exhausting, trying to change myself to fit in with them, thinking it was better to compromise. The passion always seemed to get lost too. I think there’s always been something within me that’s rebelled against the traditional, one-on-one relationship. \n\n“Then, just over 5 years ago, I started doing #polyamory. It wasn’t the ideal time, as I was feeling quite vulnerable. My best friend Amos had died the previous year. He either jumped or fell onto the train tracks at Ladbroke Grove – he was alone and there was no CCTV, so we’ll never know. Then the #GrenfellTower disaster happened 400 metres from where I live. Both devastated me, so I was in bereavement counselling and getting help for PTSD. The relationship I had at the time was very intense. We were speaking 3 or 4 times a day. I could call him whenever I was too scared of the dark to go upstairs and he’d talk me up to my bed, then read me to sleep every night over the phone. We’d agreed to try polyamory, but I did say ‘Look, you’re going to have to be patient with me because this isn’t the right time for me to get used to some of this’. He said ‘Absolutely. I completely understand.’ But him going out on other dates meant I was losing that security and safety, and a lot of PTSD is about not feeling safe. Then, if I wasn’t delighted when he said ‘Oh my God! I had such a great night! I’ve never felt like this before!’, he’d feel guilty. It also didn’t make me feel loved or supported. So we broke up, though we’re still friends.”\n\nLucy, one of the ‘living subjects’ in Nova New Opportunities'  ‘School of Humanity’ in Ladbroke Grove (1/2)",

I moved here when I got out of college. I got a job at a magazine company, packed up my dorm, and drove all my stuff straight to an apartment on the Upper West Side. Up until that point, you know, my life had moved forward in these four-year increments: high school, graduate, go to college, get your first job. I always knew there was another chapter coming. But then I worked for a few years, and that kinda turned into fifteen years. I think of how fast these fifteen years have gone.

The fucked-up part is that we agree on most stuff: parenting, religion, politics, all the important stuff. It's intimacy that we lack. Sexually, but that also applies to sharing our dreams, or preferences, or things we want. It’s partly my problem. I’m very closed off. I don't share shit. I don't share with my wife, I don’t share with anyone. Right now we’re in what’s called a therapeutic separation. Together we see a marriage counselor, and each of us is seeing our own counselor. During this trial period my job is to work only on myself. That’s what this New York trip is all about. I’m trying to figure out what I’m living for. All day at work I take care of my patients. Then I come home, and take care of the kids: do bathtime, make dinner occasionally. Take care of the yard, and the house. We bought too big of a house. So it’s a lot of work, taking care of the house. And by the time I’m finished, there goes any of the shit that I wanted to do, like my art-- you know? It’s starting to feel like if I don't make a change, then I will never be who I want to be. I'm not just a dad. I'm not just a dad. I want to be more. I need to be more. And I don’t think I could ever achieve that in this marriage. This marriage is dead. It has to die. But I have no problem building a new marriage with my wife, absolutely no problem with that. Every Monday we’re going on dates. We hadn’t dated in eighteen years, but we’ve gone on like five dates. And I’d say we’ve learned more about each other these last five weeks than we have in the past five years. I was just on the phone with her maybe an hour ago, telling her all about this trip to New York. And I told her: ‘I wish that I could share this-- what I'm doing right now, with you.’”",

  "text": "\"I grew up in Switzerland and Canada, and I came out quite young as gay, which was OK because Montreal is very open. It was when I moved here 5 years ago that I started to explore being transgender which, to me, is a much broader and more philosophical term than ‘transsexual’. It’s a way of questioning gender stereotypes which split us apart as human beings, a way of reaffirming everyone’s wholeness and unity, and basically allowing individuals the freedom to express their feminine side and their masculine side and be however they want to be.\n\n“It’s not that I feel I'm in the wrong body – I was born with this one, I accept it, I embrace it, but I don’t feel like a man, and I don’t feel like a woman either, because I don’t yet know what being a woman means. But I do feel a strong desire to identify more with the female side of myself, so now I’m about to start transitioning physically, with hormones not surgery because, at the moment, that’s not something I feel I need to do. I’ve no idea how they’re going to make me feel but that’s something I want to explore because gender is rooted in some biological reality which is mostly hormonal, having oestrogen or testosterone. I want to understand, from the inside, how hormones affect my sense of self, how I relate to other people and the world. So I’m kind of going on an adventure, I’m travelling within.”\n\n\"I’m Asian, so my family don’t really talk about sensitive or serious issues, but the acceptance is there. If it doesn’t affect our relationship and our love for each other, then I don’t think we need to discuss it. I’ve got an older sister, we’re very close, and she’s very understanding and supportive too. So I’ve been quite lucky.The lack of acceptance and understanding from strangers does bother me. As long as they're not harming anyone else, everybody should really be able to do whatever they want, however they want, whenever they want, and be allowed to change as well. It’s about freedom. I’m just trying to be happy, and expand what ‘being myself’ means. I want to develop my full potential as a human being.”\n\nBamboo, met in Windrush Square, Brixton, in June 2017\n\nNext up – Richard's great shots of #LondonTransPride...",

All the shouting, cheering, laughing and elation was so uplifting. I really did feel overwhelming pride and unity with all those lovely humans, as well as an appreciation of the efforts and trials of all those who have fought and worked so hard over the years to achieve so much for #LGBT culture and rights. \n\n“That year, armed with a dramatic ultra-wide-angle lens, I went right up to hundreds of ecstatic shouting faces trying to capture the feeling of sheer joy and engagement. What depth of support and love I witnessed! It was something I’ll never forget and I kept thinking ‘This is what life should be like always and everywhere!’ \n\n“This year, I decided I couldn’t beat those photos, and I also wanted to be in the crowd to see the whole parade go past and live more in the moments. But I got so excited I couldn’t stop myself snapping away again. I used a longer lens as I couldn’t move without losing my spot at the railing, but I still got some nice shots, and now I’m happy to be able to share some of the glorious sights, feelings and memories with friends who couldn’t be there.” \n\nRichard, a retired teacher, who's been a core member of the HoGL team since 2015.

  "text": "BEST UPDATE EVER! Most of you will remember our beloved Mary O’Halloran of Mary O’s Irish Pub. During the pandemic she rescued herself, her pub, and her family from the jaws of eviction by baking and selling her mother’s Irish Soda Bread scones. Mary’s family of regular customers did everything they could to promote the scones. Humans of New York was not the first to answer their call. No, that honor goes to Roger Clark of NY1 News, hallowed be thy name. But the HONY community followed close behind, and we came in hard. You kept ordering, and reordering, keeping Mary afloat— both economically and spiritually-- for years. But Mary’s ten-year lease on the pub ends next year. With the way rents are rising, this almost certainly meant the end of Mary O’s Irish Pub. But Mary had a crazy idea. She was going to rent ANOTHER store, for the sole purpose of selling scones. Here I must shamefully admit: I told her not to do it. Mary is a giant in the Heart Department, and a giant in the Faith Department, but she is a bit deficient in the Accounting Department. I told her to focus on selling online. ‘Mary,’ I said, ‘You cannot handle the stress of paying rent on two storefronts in NYC.’ But thank God Mary does not listen to anyone. She opened Mary O’s Irish Soda Bread Shop about a month ago at 93rd East 7th Street, in the heart of the East Village. And I’ve never seen anything like it. Every day the line is further out the door. Mary O’s Irish Soda Bread shop is taking the city by storm. No marketing. No business plan. Just the perfect scone, and a hardworking mother-of-six that everyone seems to love. Anyway, let’s all do our part to fan the flames of this wildfire. Visit the shop. Spread the word however you can. And if you’re one of the thousands who have tasted these impeccable scones, give the store a review on whatever platform you can. Long live Mary O’s Irish Soda Bread Scone Shop! Long live Mary O’s Irish Pub! And long live Mary O!",

That’s my better half right there. I can’t say that she ever looked up to me, even though I’m three years older. There were too many dumb things that I did. It’s like Pinocchio and Jiminy Cricket. She’s my Jiminy Cricket. When I’m about to do something dumb, it’s like: ‘Yo, you sure that’s the right play?’ She’s always pushing me to do my best. With her words, mainly. But she also actually pushes me. My little sister has got bigger muscles than me, bro. Starting in elementary she was playing basketball with me and my friends. She was captain of our high school team, all four years. She’s the whole reason I became a coach. I’d be watching her games, seeing what she was doing wrong. I’d watch YouTube videos to see where I could help her out. Like: ‘Yo, sis, we gotta start doing this more often.’ She's played on the Panamanian National Team. She’s playing overseas, averaging like twenty-eight points per game over there. Twelve rebounds, four assists. Monster. Monster stats. If I see something wrong, I'm still going to be like, yo, bro, what are you doing? But she’s a little beyond coaching now. I guess you could call me a disgruntled fan.”",

So many of the people I see who are homeless have similar stories: they got a debilitating illness, which caused them to go bankrupt, or get addicted to drugs. Meanwhile these health insurance companies are profiting from people not getting the care they need. Millions of people suffer from that behavior. Where is the justice for those people? Maybe violence is never the answer. But this isn’t a question of morality to me. It’s a cause-and-effect thing. This is what happens when people aren’t being heard. The system isn’t working. This is where the government was supposed to step in, but it didn’t. And millions of people were left with nowhere to turn. I’m uncomfortable that violence was used.

He was managing a pizza place. He had two kids, my nephews. But after he lost his job he started dealing drugs. He didn’t last two months in the streets. Benjamin thought the world was like our family; he was too trusting of people. And Detroit is a very dangerous place to be trusting of people. The Detroit Police Department did nothing: no leads, no investigation. It’s like he wasn’t even human. You can just murder people in that city. After his death I forgot about school. I dropped my classes, started drinking more, partying more. There was a lot of sex, a lot of meaningless sex. Nothing seemed to matter. It was dark. I was so angry at God, because how could he let that happen? But it’s been four years now. And looking back—if he hadn’t been killed, so many other things don’t happen. I’d have never left Detroit. Benjamin was the one who always told me: ‘You’re special. You don’t have to stay here.’ But if he hadn’t been killed, I’d have never come to New York.

  "text": "\"I was sexually abused from the age of 5 by my stepfather. I remember feeling terrified, because he said if I told anyone 'our little secret' he'd kill my mum and my brother. It only ended because one morning, when I was 10, she came home from work unexpectedly, found me on top of him and immediately called the police. He did go to jail for a few years, but she kept in touch with him and always blamed me for ruining her marriage. I felt so ashamed and so angry. I was a very aggressive child, always getting in fights at school. Someone would say something horrible to me, just one thing, and I'd beat them up. I started drinking and smoking when I was 13, and I left school with no qualifications at all. I got married at 19 and had my daughter Renée at 21, but we separated when I was 23 after I realised that I preferred women. My mother used to tell me I'd been such a nightmare as a child that if I had any children they'd be even worse. She was wrong as I've managed to give Renée the stability growing up that I never had and, honestly, she's the best daughter any mother could wish for. She doesn't drink or smoke, she left school with 9 GCSE's, mostly As and A*s, and now, at 18, she's training to be a professional dancer. She's very articulate too. She's such a good daughter and I couldn't be more proud of her.  \n\n\"I'm also really proud of what I've achieved, considering the start I had in life. I stopped smoking 11 years ago and I haven't had a single cigarette since. I've managed to buy our home. I've held down a relationship with my partner Germaine for 8 years now and we're engaged. I've been shortlisted as a  Positive LGBT Role Model in the 2020 National Diversity Awards. Best of all, I've finally found my voice. In 2015 I set up Poetry LGBT open mic night in London, and now my first volume of poetry, Charred, is about to be published. Finally speaking my truth has freed me. I've stopped feeling ashamed and started healing, and I want to help others to do that too.\" \n\nAndreena photographed by Darius Amini in October 2020.\n\n#Pride #Pride2022",

When I was living in Perth somebody threw an egg at me just for wearing skinny-leg jeans! It's still a very small-minded place in some respects. I feel people haven't been educated enough, or properly, especially in schools, which meant it was very hard growing up there. I was 14 or 15 when I had the 'I'm gay' conversation with my parents and it didn't go so well. I still wasn't comfortable with it myself so there was obviously tension when it came up because I was still trying to accept it. I think it just caught them by surprise, they couldn't really understand it. They had trouble wrapping their heads around how or why a man could be attracted to another man.\n\n\"After I came out it was a lot easier because I stopped hiding. I was just being myself more and saying 'I am going out to a gay club and I'm going to wear this! You haven't kicked me out, so you're not going to do that. You still love me, I'm still your son and I'm very grateful, but if you have a problem with this it's your problem, you're just going to have to get used to it.' So it wasn't the smoothest ride, but as the years passed they grew to accept me for who I am, even with the gayness, and now they show me nothing but love and support. They're amazing. I love them so much, and I wouldn't be who I am, the core of me - all my morals - without everything I've learnt from my mum and my stepdad. So for that I am forever grateful.\"\n\nKaz on Westminster Bridge in front of the London Eye, after performing for Pride in London in 2017. \n\n#Pride #PrideInLondon",

  "text": "Today we’re celebrating 50 years of #PrideInLondon. The UK’s very first Gay Pride rally happened in London on 1st July 1972, organised by the newly-formed Gay Liberation Front – the country’s first direct action human rights movement of openly lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. It’s aim was to combat the invisibility and denigration of the queer community, and to help empower them to be out and proud. At the time, nearly all LGBT people were closeted and many felt ashamed of their sexual orientation and gender identity. Homosexuality was still viewed as an illness, lesbian mothers had their kids taken off them by the courts, you could be sacked from your job for being LGBT, and thousands of gay and bisexual men were still being arrested for consenting, victimless behaviour.\n\nSome 700 people turned up for the carnival style parade which went from Trafalgar Square to Hyde Park, despite the heavy, aggressive police presence and the very real fear of being arrested just for kissing someone of the same sex in public. There were extravagant costumes and cheeky banners poking fun at homophobes like ‘morality campaigner’ Mary Whitehouse. \n\nSince then, #Pride has become a celebration of hard-won equal rights, and freedom for people to be themselves, as well as ongoing activism to redress the many injustices and discriminations still suffered by members of the LGBTQ+ community. The message is loud and clear. Be you. Be proud. Be fearless. Be beautiful. Be free. \n\nWith love and pride from Humans of London ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜",

I was nervous too, like any prospective father, but even more so as I inherited a rare genetic condition called Usher’s Syndrome from my parents. This means I was born profoundly deaf and my eyesight has gradually deteriorated throughout my life too. My central vision is OK, but I don’t have any peripheral vision left. I also struggle to see in the dark or when it’s too bright and sunny. But I reminded myself that I’ve adapted to new challenges all my life. Like the variety of roles I juggle in my job at the Financial Times, or when I stood for the Green Party in the 2017 General Election and won over 1,000 votes. If I put my mind to something, I’ll always find a way to do it. So why not start a family too? \n\n“When my partner Lauren, the love of my life, gave birth to our son Joey, we knew he’d have to adapt to my communication needs from an early age – and he did! He’s hearing like Lauren, and his English is already very good, so he understands when she explains to him about my needs. He knows to stay close to me when we are out and about so that he doesn’t suddenly vanish from my field of vision, not to stand in my way so I don’t trip over him, and to tap on my leg to get my attention.

Lauren and I are a good team. We’ll share the housework, make sure we both get some ‘me time’, and we learn a lot from each other. Of course it’s easy for any parent to feel guilty, but nobody can do everything. I just try to enjoy each day, and always put love and family above my own desires because I know that life is short, and they’re what matters the most.”\n\nBen and Joey, photographed by Stephen Iliffe for his Deaf Mosaic project. \n\n-----------\n\nThis week it's Deafblind Awareness week.

  "text": "“I came to the UK from Nigeria for safety in 2012 because I was wanted by the authorities there for being a gay man. After a while I met this wonderful Bulgarian lady called Tanya. She was so kind and showed me love and care. When she asked me to marry her I couldn't refuse because I needed help, refuge, and a place to call home. It was also a way to keep hiding my true sexuality. We got married in 2014 and I always felt guilty about not being honest with her, but I was still too ashamed to tell her why I’d had to leave Nigeria. My impotence and the lack of sex did cause some big arguments, but she only found out the real reason after I'd applied for an EU-citizen's spouse visa and the Immigration service accused me of having paid her and detained me. I was eventually released but by then my wife had discovered the truth. She was very unhappy about it, asking me to leave her house and refusing to help me any more. I was homeless for about a month, sleeping on the bus, on the street or in friends’ houses, and I was so depressed I thought of taking my own life.\n\n\"But then I searched on the internet for organisations who help people like me and I found the Say It Loud Club. Their first meeting I went to, in January of this year, was a turning point in my life. I met the Club’s founder, Aloysius Ssali, and the love and awesome welcome he showed me finally gave me the courage to come out. He’s been a huge inspiration to me, as have the stories of other refugees like me who they’ve helped. I sent my wife flowers and several apology letters asking her to find it in her heart to forgive me, and in the end she did. We're now friends again, we talk and text each other now and then, and we have agreed to divorce peacefully. I’ve realised that my story isn’t the worst, and that I should not be ashamed to share my own struggle because I don’t know who else it will inspire.”\n\nUche, met in October 2019 as he was volunteering at the Empathy Museum and Choose Love's ‘A Mile in My Shoes’ pop-up in Soho.",

And as soon as my work schedule stops, my mom schedule starts. I’m on the way to pick them up right now. I know the bond is there. Oh my God; they’re so attached to me. But I feel like they only get to see the strict mom, the military mom. The school is always asking us to do more academic things with them. So it’s a lot of: let’s do homework, let’s read books. Then after that it’s: we have to eat, we have to take a shower, we have to go to bed. And let’s do it fast. Because you need to get to sleep. You need your rest, because we have so much to do tomorrow. I feel like what I’m missing most, at this moment, is fun. There’s no time for fun. I don’t want them to only see me as a mother. I want them to see me as a friend, a best friend. Someone who will do crazy stuff with them. I heard that it might rain today. So I’m hoping, really hoping, that we get caught in the rain today.”",

Then I have an edgelord older brother, who’s all: ‘I’m a Satanist.’ OK, Andrew. Let’s calm down. My dad is more of a Mexican Catholic Guy. He just copes. He’s really banking on the whole last rites thing, so he’s kinda sorted. Honestly, I wish I was religious. At least they have something. Because for me it’s like: ‘Oh shit, there’s nothing next.’ And that doesn’t sound nice. But ultimately life is just a series of chemical reactions, which is a depressing way of thinking about it. But I mean, I’m pretty sure that’s what’s happening here. Even these thoughts—they’re just a series of chemical reactions, and one day the reactions end, and you can’t think anymore. I don’t even want to think about it. My therapist was like: ‘You should really stop thinking about it.’ I’ve actually chilled out a lot from when I was at my worst. Here’s something I use to comfort myself: ultimately my body is going to decay and I’ll get recycled back into the earth, right? And maybe a mushroom will spring up from my body. That’s a new form of something-or-other. And when the Earth finally comes to an end--my molecules will still be there, in some form. Just floating through the universe, forever. So that’s nice, I guess. That’s a comforting thought.”",

I wanted affection. And for him to give me attention, it was like—I wanted that. I did want it. I wanted him to look at me. I would dress for him. It makes me sick to think about now, but I would choose my clothes solely to make him look at me. I wanted him to say that I was pretty. I wanted his attention. And because I wanted it at first, you know—I felt like I gave myself to this person willingly. That’s why I didn’t report it for so many years. Because I felt like I was tempting him. He waited until I turned eighteen. And every time he abused me, he encouraged me to share the responsibility. He used the word ‘we.’ Always ‘we.’ He’d say: ‘We’re not supposed to be doing this. You’re making me do this. I don’t want to, but you’re making me do this.’ Every time it was over, he’d say: ‘Now go to church and confess. Confess to tempting an older man.’ I sued him last year, thanks to the Adult Survivors Act. I expected him to fight it tooth and nail; deny everything. But a couple days ago he sent a statement to my lawyer, basically apologizing for everything. When I got the letter, I thought of the child me. All I did in my mind was hug that child. It’s like: you can forgive yourself now. There was never any ‘we.’ He knew you didn’t have a father figure. He knew how you’d respond to the attention. He knew how you’d respond to the guilt, and the shame. He knew everything. It may have felt like you were choosing, but you weren’t. You were chosen.”",

But there's still no justice, or any significant change in the people, priorities and processes which created this disaster.\n\nI made myself go down there, to Ladbroke Grove, a few days after it happened. I made myself look at and photograph that grisly black coffin of a tower, and I made myself think of the individual, warm, messy, laughing, crying, creating, fearing, loving lives that had been needlessly lost.

So for him to survive all that, and live long enough to become my father—it’s a miraculous thing. He died before I was eight years old. But it was enough time to experience him deeply. I was very loved, very welcomed, very cared for: my parents were thrilled I was their child. When I was younger I traveled quite a bit. Not every place, but a lot of places: Greece, Turkey, Alaska. And this wasn’t just going on tours. It was real, vagabond stuff: no reservations, no plans. Just deeply experiencing another culture and another place. I’ve gotten to do every kind of work, from agricultural labor to factory work. For twenty years I was a social worker with seniors. But I can’t even call that a job, it was a service. I got to take care of people: bring them meals, help with housekeeping. It was an absolute calling. I was a workaholic. And now that I’m retired-- I'm a play-aholic. There’s nonstop free music in New York. I come to this park to listen to jazz piano. I go to Juilliard to listen to student recitals. There’s going to be a Dixieland ragtime ensemble near Macy’s. I mean, it’s endless. I’m just grateful for good health to enjoy it all. So many people wake up in pain. But I have my health, and I have a home. I mean, it’s not a home. But I have a place. A safe place to rent. It’s just been a blessed, beautiful life. The perfect life for me. I found it very, very rich. Very deep. And I think all of it was a blessing. All of it, miracles and blessings.”",

  "text": "\"I worked for 9 years as a prison chaplain in Wandsworth and Pentonville men's prisons and that was a real eye-opener - I'd never realised the extent of child-abuse before. So many men inside were abused as children, not just sexually but physically, mentally, emotionally. That was at the root of a lot of their offending behaviour because they perceived themselves to be worthless, so it didn't matter what they did. The difficulty was, there was very little treatment or help for them. When I was at Pentonville, with the Roman Catholic chaplain Charlie, we managed to get some money to have one therapist coming in, one day a week, and she could manage maybe 4-5 sessions in a day. But we had lists as long as your arm of people we'd like her to see.\n\n\"The best help any of us can give to anyone in that situation is just to treat them like a human being. Recognising that they are human and that they are valuable because of that, rather than dismissing or demonising them. You see an aggressive guy who's 6-foot-tall, shaved head, covered in tattoos - he looks terrifying! What you don't realise is - inside that guy is the little boy who was abused. No-one can see that. A lot of addiction is self-medication for buried pain, and men in particular will often act out their stored-up anger in violent ways. Then they might damage their own kids and the cycle repeats, over and over again. Of course, there are some prisoners who are just bad people, but the majority are not. You know that quote from a Chief Inspector of Prisons about jails being full of the mad, the bad and the sad? The mad and the sad shouldn't be in there, that's why there's all this overcrowding. But, sadly, there don't tend to be a lot of votes in 'reform of the criminal justice system'. Most people aren't interested because the only contact they have with criminals is through reading sensationalist newspaper reports.\"\n\nRobbie, met 5 years ago yesterday, as he was checking out Carrie Reichardt's wonderful 'Tree of Life' mural on the South Acton Estate with his family.",

  "text": "(2/2) “We were asked to choose a ‘living subject’ title that learners would immediately identify us as, and then debunk the myths and stereotypes around that. So I chose ‘Wheelchair User’, because disabled people are generally seen as quite passive recipients of care and support, which of course I’m not. Having said that, I have to deal with all the pressures of the modern world the same as everyone else, but also all sorts of very real systemic barriers which takes a huge amount of organisation. What we want people to know is that they should share some of that burden, not just leave disabled people to do all the heavy lifting. Because we all have a joint responsibility to make sure that the world is as inclusive and accessible as it can be for everybody and act in solidarity. It’s not enough to just be ‘aware’. \n\n“The 2 big principles of the Disabled Movement are 'Rights not Charity' – that we want the same rights as everybody else, to be able to act as equal citizens, and to contribute to and benefit from society in equal measure, and 'Nothing about us without us' – there should be no conversation going on that affects our lives without us being part of it. The Disabled Movement started about 50 years ago, alongside the Civil Rights Movement in America, and the 2nd wave followed the passing of the Disability Discrimination Act in 1995. But over this last 10-12 year period we've seen a relentless attack on our community, which was already far, far behind in terms of social capital and representation, through cuts to public services, civil society institutions and our own organisations. And the amount of disabled people who died during Covid is incredible. I had it twice, so just surviving that was a mission in itself. I’m really glad and grateful that I did, because I love life. I’m so proud of the job I do too. I just love seeing disabled people come together and discover that sense of power and collective agency, and then taking that back into their own lives and doing new things. That’s a success I just love to see.”\n\nAndy, one of the ‘living subjects’ in Nova New Opportunities ‘School of Humanity’ at the Byline Festival in Ladbroke Grove.",

  "text": "(1/2)“I was born in Ireland in 1975 with no legs and one arm. It’s just a numbers game – with 8 billion of us, there's going to be a few limbs missing. My father would say ‘We can give you every bit of guidance, but there’s nothing physically that we can do to help you. You’re going to have to depend on yourself and figure out how to live your life on your own terms. Otherwise you’ll be someone who has no choices in life, who has to take what they’re given and be happy with it.’ It was tough love I got, from both my parents, and it worked for me, very much so. \n\n“Growing up in Athlone, which was poverty-stricken, violent and crime-ridden, that helped me too. The Troubles next door in Northern Ireland made your extreme poverty feel OK compared to seeing people being blown up at breakfast, lunch and dinner and bodies shovelled into bin bags. So even neighbouring kids who weren’t disabled, their parents would be exactly the same. They’d go ‘Look, this is a tough world. You’re just going to have to get out there.’ You didn't get on in that kind of environment without developing some sort of inner core strength. So I think it kind of forged me. \n\n“We moved over here in ‘91 when my parents divorced. Even though some people were living hand-to-mouth here too, it was still levels above what we were used to in terms of state services, income levels and material possessions. So it looked a lot easier to get on over here, and I took that attitude and core strength which got me through the 70s and 80s over there and lived my life as if I had legs and 2 arms. I just did not let it stop me. I went to football, I went to festivals, I held down jobs, I brought up my kids, I travelled. I found a way of doing all of it. I'm also quite well-educated - the Irish education system is fantastic. Now I work in promoting disability culture and independent living. I love watching people being excited and enthused about their lives – whether that’s clients, or my kids and grandkids. That moves and inspires me. So I do feel very lucky and privileged.”\n\nAndy, one of the ‘living subjects’ in Nova New Opportunities ‘School of Humanity’ at the  Byline Festival in Ladbroke Grove (1/2)",

I was so bad at school that I acted like a clown just to avoid everything; then I got caught running around here with a pistol when I was thirteen. They sent me to Tryon Juvenile Detention Center, and that’s where I met Ms.Lakewood. She taught the computer class. Heavy-set Italian lady, about 4’ 10”.But attitude, huge. Aura, big. She was like the grandmother in a mob movie. You know how you’ve got all the bosses, but when the grandmother comes in—everyone shuts up? She was like that. But she was loving too. She had pictures on the wall of all her favorite students; she called them her babies. She even had a picture of Mike Tyson up there. He was one of her babies. One day we had this contest, on the computer. The winner got $50. And I was looking at the screen and getting so angry. I’m crying, because I couldn’t read. And that’s when thisSpanish kid called me Forrest Gump. He had the whole class laughing at me. MissLakewood was like: ‘What’s going on?’ She came over to me and said: ‘Fix your face. Fix your fucking face, I don’t want to see another tear.’ Then she said:‘Tomorrow, you better get ready.’ She started working with me for an hour-and-a-half, every night. She started me on Lion King. It was a preschool book, so I didn’t want to do it. But she made me. Every night she made me keep reading until I was able to read on my grade level. I started getting report cards with nothing less than 85. I was sending them home; my mom was getting hyped. I got my GED. I started reading so much. Today I can finish a five-hundred-page book in two days. If I smoke a blunt first, I swear to God I can picture the whole book like it’s a movie. Miss Lakewood passed away when I was eighteen. I heard about it while I was in prison. Some new guys came in; they’d been in Tryon too. They heard me talking about her and that’s when one of them told me. But he said: ‘Yo. I’m pretty sure she had your picture on the wall.’”",

  "text": "“I was seventeen. Only child, not a lot of friends. But I had a plan. I was going to become an actress, get a role on All My Children, meet my husband on set-- and when that was all over—I’d host a talk show. Kelly Ripa did it; I could do it too. Back then it seemed like every woman on television had gotten their start as beauty queen. So my senior year I decided to enter my school’s Homecoming Queen competition. It was organized like a Ms. America pageant. But this was a rough high school, only one other girl signed up-- so I had a good shot. My whole family got behind me. My mom was a seamstress. We noticed that in most pageants we watched, the winner wore a white dress. So she sewed me a white dress that I picked out of Seventeen Magazine. First came the interview portion, and that’s when the trouble started. The judges asked me about the Anita Hill testimony; I wasn’t ready for that. I was ready for world peace. They were supposed to ask me about my goals, so I could say world peace. But that didn’t happen. The talent portion was later that night at the homecoming dance. The whole school was there. I chose a Sheena Easton song; poor choice. Not the right crowd for that. The other girl chose ‘I Feel Good’ by Stephanie Mills, and she had the whole crowd singing along. That’s when I knew it was over. But then, a miracle. The guidance counselor quieted everyone down, and announced the winner: it was me. Me! It was my Kelly Kapowski moment. Everyone was cheering, the other girl congratulated me. But it only lasted five seconds, because the guidance counselor said: ‘Wait a second, I’m sorry. Joanna is the runner-up.’ It was the worst moment of my life. In fact, the only thing that got me through COVID was knowing that it could not possibly, possibly be worse than that moment. And here’s a twist for you. Remember that guidance counselor? Several years later I ended up acting alongside his son in a play at Queens College. In one scene I pulled a gun on him, and the director was like: ‘We need more anger. Think about something that makes you angry.’ I was like: ‘Well, that’s easy. His father ruined my senior year.

Whenever I’m talking to someone about it, I just hope they’ll ask me enough questions so that I can talk about UNC Ultimate. That was probably the most special experience I'm ever going to have in my whole life. I was on the team for five years, then I came back and coached. My freshman year we were really, really bad. But at the moment UNC Chapel Hill is triple back-to-back-to-back national champions. And I got to be part of that trajectory. But even though the team kept getting better and better, I kinda stayed at the same level. I never became the elite player that I wanted to be. I have a lot of ‘stick-to-it-ive-ness.’ I’m capable of working really, really hard. And part of me always believed that would be enough, which is the part that burned me out. Because after working so hard, for so long, I reached a plateau. It was physical stuff. I'm just not quick enough. When I play defense I can’t keep up with the fastest offensive handlers. They're going to score, and that's a problem. I ended up getting cut from the elite women’s club team I was on. I switched over to mixed, but ended up tearing my ACL a couple years ago. It’s been my life for ten years, but now I’m at a place where I don't know if I'm ever going to play again. I just don’t know if my body can handle it. I don't want to have another, like massive orthopedic surgery. And frisbee takes up so much bandwidth; there’s so many other things I want to explore. The list is infinitely long. I’m asking myself: could I be happy playing on a mid-level team where the commitment wouldn't be quite as high? Or will I only feel satisfied if I'm exceptional? That’s an unhealthy connection I have in my head, I think. That love is something you need to earn. And being exceptional will make me worthy of having connections with people. It would be great to become a version of myself where I no longer feel that way. And maybe we'll get there someday. We’re working on it. In the meantime, at least I got to talk about UNC Ultimate.”",

I’d really missed her fizziness. While I’m working in production, behind-the-scenes, Viv is a front-facing, all-singing, all-dancing, all-playing ball of music and movement. She’s already got an agent and a Spotlight profile, and she’s obsessed with musical theatre and regularly auditions for West End shows. Of course, now that she’s 11, she’s also hitting those pre-teen moods and I’m having to fire-fight her stubborn rages. But I’m reminded every day that the most important thing is to keep trying to bring more light and magic into our lives and take joy in each moment. I’m still a single parent and it’s still hard, but we’re stronger together.”\n\nFarah & Viv, outside the Epcot Centre for Scientific Innovation in Florida (2/2)",

I finished my Fine Art Masters and got a Distinction. Then, about a year after we met you, Viv won a bursary award to go to a private primary school which did art, and now that she’s just passed her 11-plus, that’s helped her get another bursary to go to a really good private secondary school. She can carry on doing her art, piano, clarinet, tap-dancing, street dance, singing, acting, netball, hockey, football, everything, whereas the State schools were all saying ‘You’ll have to pick just one’. It was stressful, applying to so many schools and filling in all those forms, but she got a few offers, we got to choose, so it worked out well. When I decided we had to move out of our support zone and buy a house closer to her primary school, the bank wouldn’t give me another mortgage because I’m a single parent. They wouldn’t even lend me £5,000. So I had to buy the cheapest house in London with the cash that was left from the house-sale after the mortgage was repaid and spend 2 years doing it up myself. \n\n“A couple of years ago, the absent dad she’d never met re-emerged and she’s had some sporadic contact with him and his family since, but it still feels very new and weird. I think she’s smarter and less bothered by it all than me. She just shrugs it off, whereas my heart still breaks daily that she only really has me, and I still feel so much guilt and remorse for the past and fear for the future too.”\n\nFarah & Viv, taking a selfie on a bluebell walk through Chalet Wood this Spring (1/2)",

Everybody needs a welcome from somebody else so that they can feel useful. It’s a real source of energy. And when you realize you’re not getting that as much—what happens is you get scared. And you also say: maybe we could do something a little different. So at some point we came up with the idea of the cute older couple. We were hoping to find some younger friends. We’ve always been attracted to younger people. You know, young people struggle. So we like to support them and wish them well and give them a lot of approval. And young people need cute old couples. They love cute old couples. So we decided to play it up a little bit. That’s what it is: ‘play.’ It’s really play. Have you ever seen two dogs greet each other? One dog will drop down, and bam, suddenly they’re playing. I think that’s what we’re doing. We’re inviting a play response.”",

But those days of painting all the time were such a roller coaster. There were these periods of extreme depression, followed by manic states of trying to put myself out there. I couldn’t do it anymore. I mainly felt sorry for my dad. I know it was rough for him. My mom hadn’t wanted me to go to art school. She wanted me to do something more practical, but my dad said: ‘No. This is what he wants to do, and I want to support his dream.’ And then I abandoned it. That was the first time I had to deal with real failure. A lot of times when you’re an artist—it’s your job, it’s your lifestyle, it’s your entire fucking identity. It wasn’t like I failed to do a thing. It was like: I failed to be something, you know? It was a failure to live up to what I thought was my destiny. But then on the other side of that-- there was this figuring out that there was nothing wrong with me the entire time. I didn’t need to be something else to have meaningful friendships, or a good relationship. I didn’t need to be something else to be loved and cared about. After work tonight I’m going to meet up with a person who’s in love with me, and I can’t wait. And that person met me long after I gave up on being a full-time artist. They met me when I wasn’t even a chef yet. I was a piss-poor, part-time line cook. But even then-- they decided I was worth it. So you know, there’s something there. There’s something there that’s enough.”",

  "text": "“My first end-of-life patient was a 97-year-old man. He had a much younger girlfriend; she was seventy-four. But they loved each other so much. Back when their spouses were still alive, the four of them had been great friends. They would double date together. And when their spouses passed away—the two of them became a thing. Every day she would come over for lunch. I’d always cook a little meal for them. I’d prepare the table; I’d lay out my little candles and my little flowers. As soon as she arrived I’d put on music and dim the lights, then I’d leave the room and go wait in the bedroom. They would cuddle and snuggle. And the beauty of it was—even though he couldn’t control his fluids at that point, she never minded the smell. Her love for him was so great that they would still kiss and all that good stuff. When the doctors said that it was time for him to go to hospice, he said he didn’t want to go. He told them that he wanted to come back home and die with me. I was with him in the end. My patients never die alone. Never, ever. One week after his passing I was hired by his girlfriend’s family. She had terminal Alzheimer’s, and I ended up staying with her for seven years. I fell in love with her. We were family, just family. She used to be a tap dancer. We’d sing together. And if she didn’t feel like singing, I’d sing. Even near the end, she always knew when something was wrong with me. When I wasn’t being the Gabby that she knew-- she would always know. When the doctors said it was time for her to go to hospice, her children said: ‘We want her to die with Gabby.’ In the final days she wouldn’t eat, she’d lock her jaw. But she would always eat for me. One night I could see the fright in her eyes, and I knew it was time. My patients never die alone. Never, ever. So I climbed under the covers with her. And she passed away in my arms.”",

But her dad left while I was pregnant (though luckily he’s always paid his child support) and 18-month-old Viv didn't like me writing articles at home because she didn't understand why Mummy was spending all these hours sitting at a table thinking. So she started pulling letters off my keyboard, and in the end she threw my laptop across the room and smashed the screen. Also, childcare provision was either dire or expensive, rates for freelancers were tumbling, and invoices were never paid on time. So I changed path and took up art instead, because that was something Viv could understand and join in with. \n\n“I signed up for lots of City and Guilds art courses and started making lino prints and screen prints and things to decorate the house.

I have a loud and boisterous child who's almost the opposite of me, so we make a good team. She has no qualms about going up to anyone and saying 'Hi! Who are you?', and often that's made a connection that's given me a new opportunity. She'll also drag me along to things.

We'd already been talking about merging our background operations because it's so difficult to run a café by yourself. If you're open for 12 hours, that's 2 shifts. Also, the suppliers we work with, minimal orders are through the roof. But there's strength in numbers. When you're running a cafe, the back-end operations are identical – staff, suppliers, overheads – and if you don't have 2 or 3 locations it's really hard to make a profit. \n\n\"We've not merged our businesses, but now we have the same team running both coffee shops. We have very similar values and interact with our staff in a very similar way, and there are synergies. Charlie's fully plant-based, I'm vegetarian, but I have a big plant-based selection, so our suppliers can cross-over. But Charlie has a vision for his company and I have a vision for mine, and there's no reason why we can't still pursue those things with the same operation. I think we're doing it in a really healthy way. Now we've got the chocolate factory, the essentials delivery service and a couple of coffee shops and everything just works. It's also allowed us both to take a little more time off and not neglect ourselves, our families and our friends for a change.\"\n\nC: \"We have each other's backs, and we've both found some great people – Marianna, who's from Argentina, and Vadim – who treat it like it's their own business, which is why we both want to give them actual shares in our companies because people like that are so so rare.

We'd worked so hard and got through the lockdowns, and having some bad eggs among the staff. Everything had just come together and now this? I remember thinking 'I know there's no lotus without mud, but really? Just give me a bit more lotus because I've had a lot of mud!' I also thought 'I can't see myself picking this back up again. It's so big that I don't know where to start.' It was all too much. Luckily just the week before I'd done a refurb and fire-proofed everything, so the fire didn't spread. There are people living above the café so that literally saved lives. There's not a lot I'll cry about but I cried that night and the next morning when I woke up too. Oscar just cradled me and said 'I'm so sorry, I don't know what to say'. It still makes me cry now when I think about it. \n\n\"Residents round here set up a crowdfunder for us the next day, and a lovely policeman who was there on the night of the fire managed it. But it took a good few months for me to get over it, physically and mentally. I paid everybody (except myself, as usual) until the money ran out. Then the insurance finally came through, although they only covered a small fraction of the losses. Eventually my dimmed Olympic torch got brighter again, and I got a creative vision about how to rebuild and redesign it to be even better. But, even after scrubbing literally everything, from floor to ceiling, it still took 9 coats of white paint to cover all the smoke-damage infused into the walls. We were quoted 20 grand for that, so we did it ourselves for about a grand. We had to learn how to use a scissor-lift for the ceiling and Oscar has a fear of heights. So he was up there with me going 'I hate you, but I love you and this is why I'm doing it'. Then Ben and I decided to join forces. (See earlier & following posts.) We'd both experienced challenges, we both wanted support and had knowledge and have a really good work ethic.

I'd struggled with my mental health from a very young age, which meant that I came out of school with nothing. Then I got into a self-destructive space with drugs and alcohol which obviously made my mental health deteriorate even more. I was really suffering from anxiety which developed into depression. I managed to get a job at a bank, despite having no qualifications, and worked my way up, but I was still miserable. Then I discovered that eating only plant-based food was drastically healing a lot of my anxiety, and I started to understand the connection between the gut and the brain and how we feel. In my spare time, I'd set up this website – mymentalhealth.org.uk – to share my experiences and allow others to share theirs, and I was going into schools talking about mental health. But I also really missed chocolate, so I built a shed in the garden of the house I was sharing in the Isle of Dogs and became a nutty professor, working late into the night constructing my own mad little machines to make the best vegan chocolate. It took me a couple of years to perfect it, then I was taking it into work and people were like 'Mate, you could sell this!' I realised that making plant-based chocolate, which is all about food and mood, could become a fun business. That's how, 5 years ago, The Well Bean Co. was born. \n\n\"It started off as a chocolate factory, then evolved into a plant-based café, thanks to Bow Arts who own all the commercial spaces down here and were my guardian angels. We'd gone from 2 staff to 8. I'd met my partner Oscar, who'd started working in the café alongside Marianna, my chocolate goddess, and we had this really cool production plan and all our ducks in a row. I was like 'This is it guys! This is the dream. Everything's perfect!' Then, in October of last year, this brand new tiny stone-grinding chocolate-making machine, which we needed to do small test batches and had arrived just the day before, shorted out during the night and set our café on fire.\" \n\nCharlie, at The Well Bean Co.

  "text": "\"I'm known as 'Bad-luck Ben'. I was working in finance and had been about to start a new job in April 2020 when the pandemic hit and the job disappeared overnight. So instead I started helping to deliver local food boxes for a café, and thought 'There's a business model here!' A friend had some cash so we started a business delivering the basics with zero waste – fresh bread in cotton bags, glass-bottled milk (including alternatives like oat or almond) and eggs in reusable cartons – to all the apartment buildings here in the Royal Docks. We launched in July-August 2020 and called it Loaf.ly – because I love puns, I use a lot of them, and I wanted it to be fun and personal. It took off really quickly. Everyone seemed to love it. But the day after I received my new cargo bike, I snapped my Achilles tendon and was told it would be 12 weeks before I could walk again. Then, on Valentines Day 2021, some kids broke into my unit by smashing a window and stole my bike, which felt so disheartening and invasive. After that, because the landlord of the unit we use up in Canning Town said it had to be a café too, we opened a little coffee and pastries shop alongside the delivered-basics and Loaf.ly became non-stop and all-consuming. I was working 7 days a week and only getting 3 to 4 hours sleep a night, but everything was lovely and going really well. Then, on March 12th this year there was another break-in and this time everything was either stolen or trashed. I cried so hard it was ugly, and I thought 'I don't know if I can pick myself up again from this'. It almost felt like a family member had died. 2 years of blood, sweat and tears, and it was just in pieces all over the floor. \n\n\"But the local community were amazing - they started up a crowd funder for us the very next day, and my friends and family rallied round to help too - even though I'd barely had time to speak to them for the past 2 years. I've still got Vadim, who's half-Ukrainian, half Bela-Russian, and is an amazing help, and I've teamed up with Charlie who owns the The Well Bean Co. and had his own disaster.

In the late 80s I got pregnant at 18 and was given a council place on an estate in New Southgate. I really loved the sense of community there and being with lots of other single mums. You didn't ever feel alone. Actually, I think estates could teach us all how to look after each other better. I became a Christian when my eldest was 18 months old, thanks to St Barnabas Church, where I'm now an Associate Minister. They accepted and cared for me. Where others might have just seen a single mum from a council estate, they saw something deeper, and they employed me as their children’s worker. So I decided I wanted to do for other people what they had done for me – to see their potential and help them become the best possible version of themselves. Eventually they offered to train me, even though I’m not your archetypal trainee vicar, and I was ordained about 11 years ago. My faith gives me courage and strength.\n\n\"I have severe arthritis in my knees, ankles, hips and shoulders so I'm in a lot of pain all the time. But you just keep going, don’t you? Everyone working in the food bank knew I was struggling but the wider community were oblivious. When we came out of lockdown, I realised I was going to have to swallow my pride and get a zimmer frame and a mobility scooter. Now I zip round on that. I’m in my 50s with 6 kids, and I used to joke that I've got more kids than CSEs (I have 5 of those). My husband is registered disabled following a stroke, and has a chronic back condition, so life certainly presents lots of challenges.

We’d always get ice cream. She’s a strawberry girl. I’m a vanilla guy. Chipwich, actually. I’m a Chipwich guy. She’d give me a hug afterward, tell me I was the best dad ever. We were such good friends. But now it feels like we’re so far apart. She doesn’t want to talk to me anymore. Even when she’s upset, she’ll ignore me and go to her room. It’s like: C’mon. I was fifteen too. I know what it’s like. But she’ll come back, I know that. They always come back. But it does feels like you’re getting your heart ripped out a little bit.  But look, I get it. She’s figuring out life. You have to back off. You have to give them space. Cause if you charge after them and get all aggressive about it, you might push them away forever. But they always come back, right? One day she’s gonna realize that I’m not the enemy and I’m really her dad, her friend. I still get a flicker of it, every once in awhile. We had a really surreal moment last year. Her birthday is March 17th. She’s a St. Paddy’s Day birthday. We always take her to a Spanish restaurant on Long Island, but this time we did something special. Her uncle used to be a bodyguard for Taylor Swift, and we still know some people at the company. So they got us tickets to her concert. Fifth row seats. I mean, don’t get me wrong. We paid for them-- but fifth row center. She was crying. I got a big hug. A big kiss.

The answer is simple: because it would melt your psyche to contact beings from another dimension. Whether it's ghosts or spirits or deceased relatives or past lives or future lives or aliens or Bigfoot or fairies, all of it will melt your psyche. Because you’ve been programmed by The Empire to believe those things don’t exist. Unless of course you’re an indigenous person raised on traditional shamanic ceremonies. I learned all this by talking to other humans on other earths in other universes, so I'm trying to not blow your mind right now. When you’re talking about other dimensions you have to use a lot of metaphors—so just imagine earth as North Korea. You’ve probably seen enough documentaries to know what's going on in North Korea.

When he saw me come out again he followed me and saw me go into this other barbers. That's the last time I remember my dad slapping me. He took me back to his shop and said 'I think you're clever.

I was raised exactly the same as my older brothers and my dad would say, 'Just because you're female it doesn't mean you can't do what a man does'. All my friends are from different ethnicities and I really wanted to find a way to bring everyone together. So in 2017 I set up Burnt Oak Womens Group.  It started as coffee mornings, then I got funding to do a community trip, and after that The Great Get Together All the local schools took part and we had performances by local dance students, a DJ, bouncy castles, a multicultural parade. It was a whole day of free fun for everyone, and I was so overwhelmed by the number of people who turned up I cried. I still have to battle preconceptions that it's a group just for Muslim women.

When I set my mind to something I will always find a way. So I asked friends who worked in supermarkets, 'Can you give me your surplus?' and suddenly there were 32 crates of food in my front garden. We ran the food bank once a week and over 300 people were turning up – the queue went round the block. We were also helping with form-filling and translation, and delivering food and medications to isolating families.

It takes your breath away.\" \n\nThat's what Anna and Helena of Finchley Food Bank, pictured here, said to me when I met and photographed them for Barnet Council's big 'Town Centre Heroes' project, celebrating those  who've gone above and beyond to help and support others. And, honestly, that's the way I felt too after meeting, photographing and hearing the stories of all the heroes currently featuring in the #BarnetTownCentreHeroes exhibition. It was just magical to meet them all and witness so much kindness and dedication, generosity and love. \n\nI'm not going to lie. The project was a super-challenging process which took almost a year and a good deal of determination to complete. But the creative collaboration between myself, Playne Design (who came up with the beautiful, super-appropriate rainbow colour theme), and Anne Poole, my co-editor from the Council, worked amazingly well. We all loved the commission, to find and publicly celebrate some of the best humans in Barnet, so we all put our hearts and souls and backs into it, and what an inspiring rainbow we've managed to find! \n\nBarnet Council invited me to tender for the commission because of the way Humans of London shares naturally recorded faces and voices, making you feel as though you might be meeting these people for yourself. So there were hundreds of portraits taken, over a hundred hours of conversations recorded and faithfully transcribed, and each story was then whittled and honed and sensitively designed to do them all justice. \n\nWe'll be featuring a selection of their faith-in-humanity-restoring stories soon here on Humans of London. And if you know any London-based heroines or heroes who have an inspiring story they're happy to share, do tell us why and put us in touch? Then hopefully we can celebrate them here too...  \n\nFor details on where to see their big, beautiful portraits in the streets and/or read their stories online, see the comments below.\n#humanity #heroes #inspiration",

The amount of mental energy it takes, you know, juggling all of them and the constant questions about nothing. I mean, mom is busy, please, just give me a second. My husband tells me that it’s just the season we’re in. We’ll get back to it. But I just want it to slow down so I can pause and breathe. Everything just changes so fast, you know? When you’re a little kid, and you turn into a teenager, it’s like: ‘Oh, I’m changing now.’ But you’ve been coached. You’re prepared for it. Then you go from teenager to college. That’s a big change. Then from college into your twenties, still changing. But at some point you kinda feel like I’m an adult, and I’m done. But you just keep going. It’s like oh shit, no, no, I’m going to keep changing. And these aren’t like the earlier changes. These aren’t the ones you get to plan for. Well some of them are, like: ‘We’re moving to a new place.’ Or ‘I’m going to get a new job.’ Those you can be ready for. But as you get older shit starts getting thrown at you that you're not planning for. Dodgeballs. And you’ve just got to pivot. And all of the sudden you realize-- that moment in time, right before the dodgeball-- that was the last time you saw the old you. And you didn’t even get to say goodbye.”",

You’re looking for that viral moment so it opens up the door and you can do the thing full time. But you start to compromise just to get the door to open: guessing what it wants, debasing yourself, alienating yourself. Until you’re not even in service to your art anymore. You’re in service to the algorithm. Deep down every artist just wants to be seen. Everyone does. And that’s how it controls you. The algorithm makes you behave in a certain way, create in a certain way, in exchange for being seen. And if something can change what you do, it can change who you are. And I didn’t sign up for that. I didn’t sign up to become a content creator. Art was supposed to be a way for me to be in search of, in service to, in community with. It was my ministry.

They did all the basics, and above all that: they worked hard to put me in a great school district. But no matter how much they provide, your parents can’t give a shit for you. I made every bad choice a high schooler could make: tv, video games, pornography. All the stuff that you use to not think about stuff. It’s immediately gratifying, maybe the first 50 or 100 times. But after the 200th time, that stuff becomes who you are. I guess the whole time I was just hoping that someone would come along and tell me exactly what to do with my life, or else it would just come to me. Maybe that happens for some people. But for the other ninety percent of us, we have to make the conscious decision to just go. At first I told my dad I was joining The Marines. He’s an attorney. It certainly wasn’t what he would have chosen for me. But he said: ‘If this is what you want to do, you’re going to visit every branch. You’re going to make an educated decision.’ On the day I signed with the Coast Guard, I remember telling him: ‘I just want to be a good man.’ That’s as far as I’d gotten. That’s the only thing that I knew for sure. I didn’t know where the path was going to lead, but I was just tired of not trying. I figured it was better to just start walking and see what the hell happens. Because I know what happens if I don’t do anything.”",

I just can’t read them anymore, not like I used to. And that was hard. It felt like I was cutting off a lifeline. It’s disappointing, the sense of not being in control of my own life anymore. Everything depends on my medical schedule, and the chemotherapy, and what my limits are. The doctor has told me to expect a couple more years, but my caretaker says she’s seen a lot of sick people. And she thinks I could be one of the ones who can beat it. For most of my life happiness was automatic. I might have had the only career where you get told ‘I love you’ three or four times a week. Maybe it happens with teachers too, but so many little kids said those words to me over the years. And I miss that. I was damned lucky to have that experience. Happiness isn’t automatic anymore, these days I have to work a little bit more for it. In addition to all the pain and the fear and having to pee all the time, I choose to do a lot of things that will make me aware of the beauty and loveliness of life. It's not magic. I don’t stop thinking about the scary stuff, I just find moments to push them aside with the ridiculous. There’s so much in life that’s ridiculous. Every Saturday morning I watch Popeye on Turner Classic Movies. It’s so ridiculous. Olive Oil is so obnoxious. And you know, she has all these men after her. It’s just really funny. And Popeye is so full of himself and somehow manages to come out of everything, eat his spinach, and win. Then there’s my laughing yoga classes, which I can’t do in person anymore. But I do them online. There’s this thing we do where people will get in lines of three or four, and we’ll pretend to have a boat race. Everyone rows as hard as they can. Someone chooses a winner, and if you lose you get to create a big scene and make an ass of yourself. It’s ridiculous. And then there’s you. You’re ridiculous. You’re stopping random people, presumably to entertain yourself. You’re sitting in the middle of the street. I mean, think about it. It’s pretty dumb.”",

She was looking so beautiful, calm and poised, revelling in the warm sunshine on Seven Dials roundabout with her afternoon coffee, so I just had to ask. Then she smiled, I photographed her, and we said our goodbyes. \n\nI've chosen to share her portraits and words again now because I've been thinking a lot about 'power' lately. What is real power? How is it used? When is it good? And International Women's Day has got me thinking a lot about the potential power of the feminine to balance things too. We surely need so much more of that in this beautiful but broken world – a second wing as strong as the first so we can all fly straight? \n\nSo we're sending our love and respect out to all you brave, powerful women who are standing up to oppression, fighting for peace and justice, and keeping the flames of love, light and laughter alive, all over the world. 💚   \n\nIf you'd like to share your stories of, or thoughts about, power here, we'd love to hear them.",

  "text": "Who knows why Valentine's Day is called that, and why it's always February 14th? I just found out thanks to a lovely post today by author Elizabeth Lesser (linked in the comments below), and what she said, after explaining its origins, really resonated. \n\n\"Our holiday today, while sweet, does little to inform us about the messy and radical experience of real love. Since holidays evolve and morph throughout the ages, I think it’s time for us to take back Valentine’s Day and recreate it for our times. Because the world actually needs a holiday devoted to real love...because we are so poorly educated in the art of love—spiritual love, community love, erotic love, family love.\"\n\nThis romantic love celebration that is Valentine's Day not only drives tonnes of cheap, throwaway purchases (so bad for the planet!), but can make many of us feel desperately lonely, or left out – if we're single and would rather not be, if we've lost the love of our lives or lost faith that we'll ever find them, if our partner is absent or suffering, if we're still struggling to love ourselves.  \n\nImagine if we could reinvent it as simply a Love Day, to celebrate all shapes and forms of the lovely, life-giving stuff? It could help us appreciate more where we're getting it, from ourselves as well as others, and inspire us all to love others better and more deeply for the rest of the year too? 💚\n\n------------------------------------\n\nThis rainbow of hearts on railings was created by 24hearts in August 2017, to honour and mourn those lost in #Grenfell.",

This is my natural shape and I want everyone to see the real me. Our studio session felt so fun and liberating, because for years I’ve had to struggle with other people’s negative attitudes to my body size – at school, college, work, in the street. Of course, many people are supportive and value me as I am, but others can be shockingly rude and dismissive. \n \n\"My parents emigrated to London from Somalia after much of our home city of Mogadishu was reduced to rubble by the civil war. I grew up in East London, in a house with 8 siblings. When I was 3, my mother found that I was deaf. But it was a warm, loving and supportive home, and all my siblings use sign language with me, so I felt included. In the outside world, it was often much harder, as I had to grow up dealing with prejudice on 4 different levels – being black, a woman, deaf, and body-plus size. Even now, plus-size women – especially black plus-size women – still get censored on Instagram and TikTok for wearing bikinis.\n\n\"But I’ve taken inspiration from the new generation of ‘body positive’ bloggers who challenge stereotypes about fat/large/plus-size people. They’ve helped me to become more comfortable in my own skin. I often get asked, 'How are you so confident?' Believe me, it took me a long time and wasn’t an easy journey, but now I know that confidence is sexy, and that the best curve on your body is your smile. Sometimes that question does make me ask 'Why shouldn't I be confident? Because I'm a plus-size?' Everyone knows I have rolls, dimples, cellulite, hip dip and stretch marks. Why should I hide away? I'm not allowing unrealistic beauty standards to stop me from living my best life. It’s time to get rid of those and start to see the real beauty in ourselves. I might not be perfect in society's eyes, but that's OK. We're all beautiful in our own way, and I'm going to make sure I'm good enough for me.\" \n\nMoona, captured by Stephen for his Deaf Mosaic project.",

So it’s two different vibes, but somehow we all end up on the balcony of the same bar. Everyone’s got beads in their hands. We’re all yelling to see boobs. Well, I’m yelling to see boobs. That was just me. But Zak had a perfect mustache. He used to grow it much longer and curl it with wax. And I normally don’t approach people, I’m not that person. But his whole family seemed cute. They didn’t seem like normal New Orleans vacation people. So I was like: ‘Can I take a picture with you?’ Then we ended up adding each other on Snapchat, because that was the thing back then. And we agreed to meet up the next day after his family was done with their gator cruise and I was finished visiting the strip club. That night we walked along the river until the sun came up. I remember doing handstands on the levees. Then at the end we kissed. It was just a kiss because I was leaving early the next morning, and honestly I thought that would be the end of it. I thought for sure I was never going to see this kid again. But we kept talking, and two weeks later I’m taking his virginity in a Las Vegas hotel room. There was something going on with his stomach that day. Right when we finished he went to the bathroom and started throwing up. I called my girlfriend and said: ‘I don’t think he likes me.’ But it’s been love ever since.”",

I could never understand: how can she be so happy, while I’m stuck in my head and constantly thinking about it? It was exhausting to me. She was exhausting to me, especially when we were teenagers. I couldn’t stand to be around her because she was so light and positive and funny. Everything was always so cool, and so good. It felt to me that she didn’t want to face it. She just wanted to accept that it happened, and move on. But I couldn’t move on. I didn’t have that choice. I couldn’t just choose to not think about it. I remember the bad things, and how they made me feel. And I never want to feel that way again. I couldn’t just go back out into the world like it never even happened. I know that there are a lot more good people than bad, I do believe that. But there are bad people too. And they can really hurt you deeply if you give them your trust. So I never trusted anyone. Three years ago it reached a point where I felt completely hopeless. It was all so exhausting. I was exhausted. Exhausted from carrying these heavy feelings. Exhausted from making bad decisions. Exhausted from the drugs. It felt like nothing was ever going to change for me. Around that time we went out to dinner with my mother, and we finally had a deep talk about everything. We’d talked about it before, but maybe this time I really meant it. I decided that I have to let it go. I just have to let it go. I still have dark times when I don’t want to study or work. But when I’m in a bad mood, I’ll turn to her. Her happiness doesn’t make me feel worse anymore. It motivates me. It inspires me. Now she’s the person who can most easily put me in a good mood. I let her be a part of my bad days. And because of that, she’s also become a huge part of my good days. Both of us have gotten a lot more mature, and a lot wiser. But it was mainly me, I think. I had to change. If I hadn’t found a way to let go, we’d still be too different to be this close.”",

My coming out had made him realise that his ideas about being gay were put on him by the Black and Indian communities where, as a man, you don't talk about your feelings, particularly anxiety, depression or vulnerability.

I'm also gay, but being in an Indian-African and Irish Roman Catholic household made me suppress my acknowledgement of that for a very long time. I struggled massively with my parents splitting up, and then with my identity and sexuality too. Even when I started out in the West End I didn't allow people to know who I truly was as I was scared of what that might do to my career. I finally came out when I met my boyfriend Mike, who's now my husband, in 2009-10. My nan had raised us when Mum and Dad split up and Mum became ill, and she's very religious, so I was really worried about how she would react.

She didn't believe that scripture was accurate and said she'd always known I was different from her other grandkids, more arty and fluid.

Daniel and I broke up - we went different ways with our lives but we still speak from time to time, and I still have no contact with my family. There have been deaths but nobody's told me, I've found out by other means. In the original post I said I didn't want to tar a whole religion which is why I wouldn't name it, but everyone in the comments guessed that it was Jehovah's Witnesses anyway. I think I had a lot of guilt at the time, and I was really trying to figure out who I was apart from a religion. Now I'm much more confident in who I am, and even my appearance is completely different, because I've become much more myself.

I'm much more open with people, and more proud to be me, rather than a bit shy and nervous. \n\n\"You don't just walk out at 16 and have a life. You have to rebuild it right from the ground, so it takes a long time to come together. But I'm no longer waiting for anything from my family. I kind of know how it is.

It caused a lot of anger and honestly, a lot of heartbreak. I even wondered if my family was cursed. Like all we do is come into this world and we struggle. From the age of twelve I had to go straight home from school and take care of my baby sister. I was the one making sure she was OK: feeding her, changing her, bathing her. It’s like my life was in shackles. I didn’t even start playing basketball for real until I was sixteen. That was the summer I was like: ‘I’m done. I’m not y’all’s babysitter.’ I started waking up early and going to the park for hours, doing drills. Basketball gave me a sense of control. The more I worked, the better I got, and it was like: ‘Wow. I can really do this.’ It’s like I was finally the one writing my story. I ended up trying out for the school team my senior year: no skills, no talent, just starting to understand the game. But the things I could do, I did better than everyone else: diving for loose balls, grabbing rebounds, and hustling. It was mainly hustle. And I think the coach saw that, or maybe he just felt sorry for me. Because he created an extra spot on the roster just for me. There weren’t even enough uniforms, I had a different uniform than everybody else, and during the away games the crowd would let me know. They let me hear it, but I didn’t care. I was just so happy to be there. I couldn’t shoot, but I’d go one hundred percent on defense. The coach would put me on the other team’s best player. I’d stay right up under his jersey. I’d chase him all over the court. And by the end of the year I was in the rotation. We won the city championship that year. During the final game our starters got off to a slow start, and the coach wanted some energy. So he looked down to the end of the bench and said: ‘Rey, go in.’ Right away I got a steal. The crowd was going wild. Proudest moment of my life. I took it all the way back down the court, and unfortunately, I missed the lay-up. Would have been a perfect ending, but man. I was just way too excited.”",

And when there’s no one to talk to, you just become your own friend. I’d look out the window and try to imagine myself doing things. Like: ‘What would it be like if I was standing on that roof? What sort of things would I see?’ But when you do that too much, at some point you get lost. I didn’t even feel alone. It’s hard to explain, because I haven’t experienced nothing else. But it's like: you don’t feel lonely if there’s never nobody else there. And there was never nobody else there. Alone was my normal. It was my comfortable. So when we first started dating, I didn’t know what to do. Every time we were alone I would speak non-stop. Then I’d stop myself mid-sentence and be like, ‘Damn. I’m speaking a lot. I need to shut up.’ And she’d be like: ‘No, just keep telling me what you were telling me.’ I was just so excited. I felt like l a kid with a new toy. I’m not calling her a toy, that’s not what I mean. But that’s how I felt. Like I don’t know how this works, but I can’t believe I have it. I’m in love now. For so long I’d told myself: ‘This is never going to happen.’ But then it actually happened. It was like: ‘What do I do? Where do I go now?’ Every day has been something new. Monday feels like Saturday, because every day has meaning. I’m figuring out about her, and about myself, and about the world. Like—I didn’t know you could have fun in winter. There’s so many indoor activities you can do, just simple things. Like wearing matching pajamas on New Years. I never knew about that stuff. It can be so fulfilling. Sometimes you don’t even have to do anything. Just having somebody sitting next to you makes you feel nice inside. And that’s how it is now. That’s how my life is. She’s my comfortable. When she’s not with me, I wish that she was. I feel what it feels to be alone.”",

But after a while I found I couldn't really manage it all any more, so I took a year out. I started working at Sainsburys and tried to decide where I wanted to go next in my life. I was in a pretty dark place.\n\n\"Then I started renting a room with my boyfriend Daniel, who's only a school year ahead of me. We'd been friends since I was 15 and we got together when I was 16. Growing up, I'd had quite a lot of depression which I didn't feel I could talk to my friends about, that they'd understand, so I did feel quite isolated. But Daniel had had similar difficulties, and I found when I told him things that I thought would make him hate me he was just so accepting. I started to fall in love with him when I realised that he wasn't judging me, but I didn't know it then. I didn't really realise what those feelings were until he told me his feelings and then I was like 'Oh yeah, that's what this is - love!'\n\n\"We're still living together now and it's really nice. Some people are shocked because we're so young, but it works for us. He's laid back but also ambitious, he's very generous, and he's got a great sense of humour. He's always making me laugh and I just love his company. I've gone back to college, I'm doing my A levels because I've decided I want to go to university and do English Literature, and now I know that life is circular. When you're in a really bad place it's going to end, some day, and when you're in a really good place, that's going to end as well, so you just have to keep moving through the bad times and make sure you really appreciate the good ones while they last too.\"\n\nKatie-Alice met by Richard on the train from Enfield Town to Seven Sisters (2/2).\n\n------------------------\n\nThis is the second of 2 posts which went up way back in October 2016. Katie-Alice kindly gave us an update yesterday, so we'll be sharing her happy news in a fresh post tomorrow.",

  "text": "(1/2) \"I had to move out of my family's home when I was 16. They're part of quite a strict religion - I don't really want to say which one because I don't want to tar a whole group of people with one brush, but it's a Christian religion and it's very strict. I'd begun to question it and then, when I decided that I didn't believe in it any more, they said that I either had to share their beliefs or I'd have to find somewhere else to live, and they'd cut me off and wouldn't speak to me any more. It was really difficult, obviously. Horribly painful.\n\n\"I really wanted to believe in a god, because it meant holding onto my family and it would make things so much easier to follow someone else's rules, but I just couldn't, which proves it isn't right for me. In a way it's quite freeing, because now I'm the judge of what's right and wrong for me, I decide where I'm going in my life. Plus I don't know if I want these people back in my life if they could abandon me when I was a vulnerable young person, just like that.\n\n\"For the past 3 years I've had no contact with my family at all, apart from my brother. He lives in Eastbourne, he went through something similar, and he's been such a great support because he understands what it's like for that to happen. He's kind of guided me through grieving for it and moving forward, saying 'It does take you a very long time to get over it, but it does hurt a bit less every year'.\n\nKatie-Alice met by Richard on the train from Enfield Town to Seven Sisters (1/2).\n\n------------------------\n\nThis is the first of 2 posts which went up way back in October 2016.

I thought it was amazing, I bought the album and knew all the lyrics, but it seemed an unattainable dream. So I studied accounting instead, because I was quite smart and good at things like calculus. I did our version of AmDram but never any big professional singing or acting jobs. Then I joined my boyfriend of the time in Hong Kong, he was working at Disneyland and I thought I might as well give it a try. When they gave me a job playing in High School Musical, I loved it so much that I dared to come to London and study musical theatre at the Royal Academy of Music. \n\n\"Now my dream has come true - I'm playing Tzipporah in The Prince of Egypt at the Dominion Theatre, and it still doesn't feel real. Maybe that's the magic of it? I hope I never lose the romance and the thrill. It's such a great story to tell - one that's been owned by people of all different religions, cultures and walks of life. It speaks to so many people's imaginations and hearts - the way Moses and his brother Ramses have to embrace their fates and put their egos aside for something greater than themselves, which is freedom and faith. The cast and crew come from so many continents too - we're all creeds and colours, shapes and sizes. It's a story of miracles and belief and, after the storm of difficulties and challenges we all faced going through Covid, I think that's something we need right now.\"\n\nChristine, met in her dressing room at the Dominion Theatre before the evening performance of The Prince Of Egypt Musical.\n\n---------------------------\n\nThis is the second of 3 humans' backstage stories we're featuring to promote The Prince of Egypt, 'an epic show about one of the most iconic stories of all time', now entering its final few weeks. \n\nThe show runs until 8 January 2022 and tickets are available at theprinceofegyptmusical.com. \n\n#PrinceofEgyptUK",

  "text": "“I’ve been doing good work lately. My schoolwork, I mean. God that sounds so nerdy. But this year I’ve been trying to make school less about the grade and more about doing work that makes me proud. To put it bluntly, I wrote some good fucking essays this year. There’s this one paper called The Term Paper. Every junior has to do it. It’s six to eight pages. Just say the words ‘The Term Paper’ to a sophomore, and they will cower in fear. It’s supposed to be the culmination of everything you’ve learned about literature. Everyone begins by making their proposal to the teacher. The coolest thing about essays, as opposed to say math, is that they're one of the only chances you get in high school to say something original. So I was like: ‘Let’s go, let’s push it.’ We were supposed to choose one book. But I told my teacher: ‘There’s an author I love named Kazuo Ishiguro, and I’d like to compare two of his books.’ She told me nobody had ever asked that before, but she let me do it. And for the longest time it seemed like I’d made a huge mistake. It took me six months. It was such a complicated argument, it took me almost twenty pages. I felt so tired. I had no idea if I was going to finish on time. Even with an extension, I turned it in fifteen minutes before the deadline. But when she gave me the paper back, she said something I couldn’t believe. She said: ‘This is graduate level work.’ It was the proudest moment of my life. It’s only been sixteen years, but still. Writing was never my strength. I think back to my crappy little paragraphs about ‘To Kill A Mockingbird’ that I wrote in seventh grade. Even in eighth and ninth grade, my essays were still pretty shit. But I started really working hard to make them better. And I just kinda kept working. And it wasn’t just six months that went into that paper. It was those six years of getting better. And I don’t know if it will get published or anything, that’s probably not something I can do. But for her to say that, it means my work is getting close to what people are actually doing out there in the world. I’m not sure if this makes sense. But it made me feel like I’m finally part of the world. Instead of just in it.”",

  "text": "I want to begin by thanking Parviz Zafari. Though it seems strange to say his name, because I’ve only ever heard him called him Bubjan, which means Grandfather. When I met Bubjan I only intended his story to be a single post. But as his life began to unspool before me, putting his soul and wisdom into a story became a mission for me. I’ve never met a man who so lived what he believed. You’ve been a great teacher to me, Bubjan. Thank you for showing me that truth is something you do. \n\nThank you to my close friend Rostam Zafari. It was his devotion to his grandfather that sparked all of this. I joke that he dragged me into his house and sat me at Bubjan’s feet. Rostam would later serve as interpreter for all 100 hours of interviews. Rostam is one of the most brilliant, talented, and ethical people I’ve ever met. He is very much like his grandfather, only he took his love of Shahnameh one step further by tattooing scenes from the book all over his body.  \n\nI want to thank the entire Zafari family: every member played a part in this. Mitra, you are the sun. Thanks to Sepanta Mohseni for holding us together in the final stretch. Thank you to Dr. Maziar Zafari, who I call ‘The General.’ He was a chief advisor to the whole project and ripped my drafts to shreds with his pencil until all the history was correct. We locked horns a few times, but we are better friends because of it. And the story is certainly better because of it.\n\nThank you to Azadeh Vatanpour and Rashid Fani, for creating a translation so good that it was often referred to as the ‘original Farsi version.’ Thank you to my agent Brian DeFiore, first and last fingerprints on all my stories. Thank you to my beautiful wife Erin, for loving me despite my obsessions. Thank you to everyone who supports Humans of New York on Patreon—you are the reason I have the space and time to do this work. \n\nThank you to the God of Soul and Wisdom, as God is called in this story. Do the next good thing, a way appears. Thank you to Mahsa Jina Amini and the women of Iran, you continue to inspire us. \nAnd lastly, thanks to all of you who read these stories. Sharing them continues to be the great privilege and joy of my life.",

To meet their children. And the children of their children. And then I’d go to his tomb. He was buried in his garden. And to stand there one more time, where he tended his trees. Where he sowed his seeds. Seven verses a day. I’d say them quietly in my head, I wouldn’t want to disturb the peace. But something happens, I can’t help it. I feel the heat. I feel the pressure. It’s like a sword pierces my body and I have to let it out: 𝑹𝒂𝒌𝒉𝒔𝒉 𝒓𝒐𝒂𝒓𝒆𝒅 𝒃𝒆𝒏𝒆𝒂𝒕𝒉 𝑹𝒐𝒔𝒕𝒂𝒎! The thunder of hooves, the spark of swords, the clash of axes, the single arrow spinning through the air. Who are these Persians? Rumi, Saadi, Hafez, Khayyam, Ferdowsi. Not even a lion! Not even a lion could stand against them! Our kings. Our queens. Our castles. Our battles. Our banquets. Our songs and celebrations. Our culture. Our wisdom. Our choices. Our story. And our words. All of our words. Words of mothers, words of fathers, words that teach, words that fly, words that cut, words that heal, words laughed, words sung, words wept, words prayed, words whispered in a moonlit garden, words of sin, words kissed, words sighed, words spoken from one knee.

A knight with a voice to make, the hardened hearts of warriors quake. A knight who rode out to face the enemy alone, and she roared. She roared! She roared at the enemy lines! Here! Here is your champion! Her wisdom, her soul, her voice, her faith, her power, her heart, her passion, her sin, her choice, her life, her fight, her fire, her fury, her justice! And her hair.

  "text": "(53/54) “It’s a beautiful word in itself, Mitra. Someone who has no idea of its meaning can appreciate its beauty. Mitra always had a genius for beauty. She knew it completely. She wanted it around her at all times. Even now she keeps a book of Hafez by our bedside. It’s always in reach, and whenever she finds a verse that she loves, she will bring it to me. She still trusts me to find the melody. Poetry is one of the things that she still remembers best. Because poetry is music. It sinks into the memory. Even if you can’t remember a word, the rhythm will guide you. The rhyme will give you a hint. Recently we were reciting a poem from an old book, and one of the words had completely faded. It was a poem that we both used to love. And I was so mad at myself. I kept trying to remember the word, but it would not come to me. Then suddenly she said it. It made me so happy. It doesn’t hurt when she forgets anymore, but it makes me so happy when she remembers. To know that the memory is still inside of her. That she is still holding on. Our lives are just a fistful of memories, ice melting in our hands. And Mitra’s ice is melting faster than mine. But she still has more memories of me than anyone else. And I have a lifetime of memories every time I look at her. And until the last moment, until the last ice has melted, we will still be us. Our entire lives we’ve been on two different roads. But the horizon was always the same. It was an unwritten promise: that no matter what happens, I will keep you. Even when we disagree, I will keep you. From a distance, I will keep you. In the dark, I will keep you. In the deepest pit, I will keep you. Even if you lose your country, even if you lose your eye, even if you lose your memory, I will keep you. We will still be us. It’s the only thing we ever agreed on. We always agreed on us. It’s one of the earliest principles of Iran. It’s where she gets her name. Mitra, the God of Promises.”\n\nمیترا واژه‌ای بس زیباست. حتا اگر درونمایه‌اش را هم ندانیم، زیبایی واژه را درمی‌یابیم. او نبوغ ویژه‌ای در زیباشناسی دارد. به درستی با آن آشناست. دوست داشت پیرامونش همیشه زیبا باشد. هنوز دیوان حافظ را کنار تختش می‌گذارد. هنوز هرگاه شعری دلپسند از حافظ ‌بیابد، به من می‌دهد تا برایش بخوانم. هنوز باور دارد که من آهنگ درست شعر را زود پیدا می‌کنم. اگر نتوانم، یاری‌ام می‌کند. شعر، یکی از چیزهایی‌ست که هنوز به یاد می‌آورد.  شعر موسیقی‌ست، پر از آهنگ و نواست، در گوشه‌های مغز جایی دارد. اگر واژه را فراموش کنید، آهنگ‌اش شما را به آن می‌رساند، راهنماست. چند روز پیش شعری از کتابی کهن را می‌خواندیم. یکی از واژگان خواندنی نبود. شعری بود که هر دو دوست داشتیم، دلم گرفت، به یادش نمی‌آوردم، ناگهان او واژه را در جایش نشاند! چه مایه شادمان شدم. فراموشی‌های او دیگر مرا نمی‌آزارند، اما هرگاه چیزی را به یاد می‌آورد بسیار خُرسند و خُشنود می‌شوم. می‌دانم که برخی خاطره‌ها هنوز در او زنده‌اند. هنوز آنها را نگه‌داشته است. زندگی مُشتی خاطره است که مانند یخ در دست‌هایمان  آب می‌شود. یخ‌های میترا به آب شدن شتاب بیشتری دارند. او بیش از هر کس دیگری از من خاطره دارد. و من خاطره‌ی یک عمر زندگی را مُرور می‌کنم هرگاه به او چشم می‌دوزم. تا واپسین لحظه، تا واپسین تکه‌ی یخ، با هم خواهیم ماند. همه‌ی زندگی‌مان، دو تا همراه بوده‌ایم. اما افق و کرانه‌‌هامان همواره همسو بوده است. کاخی بود پیرامون ما. سوگندی نانوشته: هر آنچه  هم که پیش آید، تو را نگه خواهم داشت. هم‌اندیش نباشیم، تو را نگه خواهم داشت. بر بالاترین فراز‌ها، تو را نگه خواهم داشت. در ژرف‌ترین گودال‌ها، تو را نگه خواهم داشت. اگر میهن‌ات را از دست بدهی، اگر چشم‌ات را هم از دست بدهی، حتا اگر حافظه‌ات را از دست بدهی، همچنان تو را نگه خواهم داشت. ما همچنان ما خواهیم بود. این یگانه چیزی‌ست که ما همواره بر سر آن هم‌رای بودیم. این یکی از نخستین آرمان‌های ایران بوده است. سرچشمه‌ی نامش. میترا، ایزدبانوی پیمان‌ها",

  "text": "(52/54) “It always sits out on the shelf. It’s given structure to my life. I’ve wanted to be a knight. I’ve wanted to be a king. I’ve wanted to be Ferdowsi, living for higher ideals. But there’s old men in Shahnameh too. And that’s my idea of a king now—a grandfather. A 𝘉𝘶𝘣𝘫𝘢𝘯. He’s more of a cultural figure. He advises his grandchildren. He keeps them together. But he doesn’t participate in their issues, regardless of how they behave. He’s like a book. He’s full of wisdom. He's there if you need him, but he doesn’t exert power over you. I’m reading it through one last time, with all eight of my grandchildren. It’s a deeper understanding now. To dive deep requires a philosopher’s tenacity, but the pearls are in the depths of the seas. These days I skim over the battle scenes. I read more diligently the parts that tell of universal values like love and kindness. The parts that are true for everyone. One of my favorite stories never made it into Shahnameh. It was passed down through our oral traditions. Iran is in the midst of the longest war it has ever fought. The fighting has gone on for more than a century. Many kings have died, both sides are exhausted, and a truce is proposed. A single champion from the Iranian side is selected. His name is Arash, ‘The Archer.’ He’s told to climb one of the highest mountains in Iran, and to shoot his arrow as far as he’s able. And wherever it lands, that will be the border of the new Iran. He climbs to the mountain’s peak. He pulls back his bow as far as he can, and he lets the arrow fly. It sails across the entire country. And sticks into a walnut tree—exactly where the previous border was before. Before the fighting, before the bloodshed. And that’s the new Iran. But Arash never gets to see it. He put his entire soul into the arrow. All of his 𝘑𝘢𝘢𝘯. And the moment it’s released, he falls over and dies.” \n\nهمواره بالای گنجه نمایان است. به زندگی‌ام سامان داده است. می‌خواستم پهلوان باشم. می‌خواستم شاه باشم. می‌خواستم فردوسی باشم، که تنها به آرمان‌هایش می‌اندیشد. اما کهنسالان هم در شاهنامه هستند. اکنون برداشتم از شهریار، پدربزرگ است، باب‌جان است، یک باشنده‌ی فرهنگی. او برای هم‌اندیشی با فرزندان و نوادگانش همواره هست. آنها را همبسته نگه‌می‌دارد. به زندگی روزانه‌ی آنان کاری ندارد، گزینش رفتار و راهکارهایشان با آنهاست. او مانند یک کتاب است. اگر نیاز داشته باشند در دسترس است. اما فشاری بر آنها نیست. برای واپسین بار شاهنامه را با هر یک از هشت نوادگانم می‌خوانم. اکنون برداشتی ژرف‌تر دارم. داستان‌ها همیشه برایم دلپذیر بوده‌اند. همیشه درونمایه‌ی واژگان را به جان گرفته‌ام. اما غوطه‌ور شدن در ژرفای داستان‌ها نیازمند پیشینه و پشتکار فرزانگان است. مرواریدها در ژرفای دریا نهفته‌اند. این روزها از پهنه‌ی نبرد‌های خونین زودتر می‌گذرم. بخش‌هایی را که از ارزش‌های جاودانی مردمان در سراسر جهانند، چون عشق و مهربانی، ژرف‌تر می‌خوانم، به کار همه می آیند، راستین‌اند. داستان پرمایه و دلانگیزی در اوستا هست. داستانی که در شاهنامه نیامده است. ایرانیان درگیر جنگی درازدامن با تورانیانند. جنگی که بیش از یک سده به درازا کشیده است. بسیاری از پادشاهان جان باخته‌اند، هر دو سو خسته و درمانده‌اند. پیمان می‌بندند که مرز ایران و توران تیر پرتاب کمانگیری از فراز کوه رویان باشد. از ایران سپاه، آرش است که در این کار سترگ بالا برمی‌افرازد، جان خود در تیر می‌کند. تیر بر شاخ گردویی فرود می‌آید که بر مرز راستین ایرانزمین روییده است! از آرش مگر کمانی باز نمی‌ماند. سیاوش کسرایی چه زیبا سروده است: جان خود در تیر کرد آرش  /  کار سدها سدهزاران تیغه‌ی شمشیر کرد آرش",

The impatience is building, and soon it will come out. Iran will come out. Our young women have been leading us. But we cannot let them march one-by-one into the night. Do not pass by silently if a woman is getting harassed in the street. Do not let them be called whores or sluts. Speak! Say this is not right! Your neighbor will hear you, and they will say it too. Until all of us are saying it together. The only way to take the battlefield is together. Those of us in free societies, with the freedom to speak, and write, and protest. Do not sit behind the walls of your castle. Write. Speak. Protest. We don’t need the same chants, or the same slogans.  But let us come together. Even if it’s only around our dining room tables, let us come together. We cannot let them face the enemy alone. In Iran they are standing up: the students of Tehran, the truck drivers of Bandar Abbas, the oil workers of Khuzestan, the factory workers of Pooladshahr, the teachers of Sanandaj, the farmers of Isfahan. Everyone has found their own way of saying: ‘This does not work for us.’ Everyone is choosing their own words, but now let us say them all together. If you can’t find the courage to march in the streets, then just open your doors. Stand on your stoop as the protesters pass. That would be enough. If everyone who is against this regime could only do that, we’d fill all of Iran. It will be the end. These enforcers will realize that there is no one with them. Because those policeman, those soldiers, they’re also the people. Iran lives inside of them too. There is only one battle left. The fight against fear. When we win against the fear in our hearts, we win Iran. And in the words of Ferdowsi: ‘Without fighting, they will flee the scene.’” \n\nخیابان‌ها آرام‌اند. اما درون خانه‌ها، جایی که ایران هنوز زنده است، بانگ کوس‌ها رساتر می‌شود. خشم‌ها پدیدار می‌شوند. ایران رخ می‌نماید. زنان جوان‌مان رهبری را بر عهده گرفته‌اند. نگذاریم یکایک در تاریکی شب ناپدید شوند. تنها راه پیروزی در میدان نبرد همبستگی‌ست. ما که در جامعه‌های آزاد زندگی می‌کنیم و آزادی سخن گفتن، آزادی نوشتن، آزادی گرد هم آمدن داریم. پشت دیوارها‌تان نمانید. بنویسید! سخن بگویید! خود را نشان دهید! نیازی نیست که شعارها‌مان، اعتراض‌ها‌مان یا سرودهای‌مان یکسان باشند. بیایید با هم باشیم. حتا اگر پیرامون سفره‌‌مان باشد. بیایید با هم باشیم. نگذاریم به تنهایی با دشمن روبرو شوند! در ایران همه به پا خاسته‌اند. دانش‌آموزان تهران. رانندگان کامیون‌های بندرعباس. کارگران صنعت نفت خوزستان. کارگران کارخانه‌ی پولادشهر. آموزگاران سنندج. کشاورزان اصفهان. هر کدام راه خود را پیدا کرده‌اند تا بگویند: \"دیگر این برای ما کارآمد نیست.” هر کسی واژگان خود را برمی‌گزیند، بیایید هم‌آوا و همراه آنرا فریاد بزنیم. خاموش نمانید. بی‌اراده از کنار زنی که در خیابان آزار می‌شود، نگذرید. نگذاریم آنها را فاحشه یا هرزه بنامند. سخنی بگویید! بگویید که این کارتان درست نیست! دست از زشت‌کاری‌هایتان بردارید! همسایه‌تان می‌شنود و او نیز با شما همصدا خواهد شد. تا زمانی که همه‌ی ما همصدا آنرا تکرار کنیم. بیایید با هم باشیم. اگر شجاعت پیوستن به راهپیمایی‌های خیابانی را ندارید، درِ خانه‌‌هایتان را بگشایید. جلو در بایستید و تماشاگر حرکت پهلوانان‌تان باشید. اگر این کار را انجام دهیم، همه‌ی ایران را پُر خواهیم کرد. این  نبرد پایانی ماست: نبرد با ترس. هنگامی که بر آن پیروز شویم، ایران از آن ما خواهد شد. هنگامی که ایران بُرون آید، به معنای راستین بُرون آید، به پایان شوربختی‌ها می‌رسیم. سرکوب‌گران، پاسدارها، نیروهای انتظامی، همه خواهند دید و خواهند فهمید که ما با‌همیم و آنها تنها. همانگونه که فردوسی می‌گوید: همه جنگ ناکرده، بگریختند / همه دشت، تیر و کمان ریختند",

We know how hard we can push our bodies before we have to stop, and we do have to look after them for our careers. I am covered in bruises, and yes, my feet do hurt most of the time. I'd much rather dance barefoot because I feel like you know where you are, you can feel everything. When you dance in shoes you can't, and you never know...a heel could snap and over you'd go. But I'm so happy to be in a show where the dancing is so active and I really get to use all of my training. I'm part of the ensemble which is exhausting because we do 8 shows a week, we're almost always on stage, and the dancing is so full-on, full of leaps and gymnastics and throws. But the buzz you get when the whole audience leaps to their feet at the end of the show and starts clapping is just amazing. That’s when we know we’ve delivered. I remember coming to watch Wicked in the West End when I was 16, which was absolutely incredible, and thinking 'This is where I want to be!' Now I am, I'm a real West End Wendy, and I feel so blessed. It's a dream come true.\" \n\nSasha, met in the Dominion Theatre during rehearsals for The Prince of Egypt. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is the first of 3 humans' backstage stories we'll be featuring over the next 3 weeks to promote The Prince of Egypt, 'an epic show about one of the most iconic stories of all time', which is now entering its final few weeks. \n\nThe show runs until 8 January 2022 and tickets are available at theprinceofegyptmusical.com. \n\n#PrinceofEgyptUK",

My mum danced when she was little, my auntie's a dance teacher, my older sister used to dance and my younger sister still does, she's doing competitions and festivals. My brother doesn't. But I was the one who was like 'This is what I want and I've gotta go for it!' So I went to the Birmingham Ormiston Academy, it's a performing arts school where you do your academics but you also do your dance pathway. Then I went to Phil Winston's TheatreWorks in Blackpool and trained there for 3 years, and as soon as I left, I was so lucky, I got my first job touring in BBC Strictly Come Dancing with Aljaz and Jeanette. After that I was in Cats in Victoria which I loved, and now I'm in The Prince Of Egypt Musical, which I still can't quite believe.\"\n\nSasha met in the Dominion Theatre during rehearsals for The Prince of Egypt (1/2) \n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nThis is the first of 3 humans' backstage stories we'll be featuring over the next 3 weeks to promote The Prince of Egypt, 'an epic show about one of the most iconic stories of all time', which is now entering its final few weeks. \n\nThe show runs until 8 January 2022 and tickets are available at theprinceofegyptmusical.com. \n\n#PrinceofEgyptUK",

  "text": "(50/54) “When I was eighty I was giving an interview on Persian television. I wanted to recite a verse, from the part of Shahnameh when Rostam selects Rakhsh as his horse. But no matter how hard I tried, I could not remember the line. For almost a minute I sat still. After that I stopped giving speeches. I’m at a new stage now. I’ve accepted this. It’s like an arrow that’s descending. It’s been a long flight. But it’s nearly reached its destination. I’ve done all I can. So now I try to think through the soul of our people. It’s in the hands of the young people now. They’re the ones with energy. They’re the ones that can change the regime. In the great battles of Shahnameh, as long as the flag is flying high—the army remains strong. The flag must stay raised. When the flag falls, the battle is lost. The flag of this regime is the hijab. For as long as I can remember. For my entire life, it’s the thing they’ve cared about most. It’s something that can be visualized. Something that can be seen from afar. No matter how low they sink, no matter how weak they are, it’s the one proof that they’re still in control. That they still control half of Iran. They’ve made it their flag. But their castle is surrounded. The flag is falling fast. And when it finally hits the ground, the regime will end. Mitra and I do whatever we can to support. We go to the protests.  She wears her ‘Woman, Life, Freedom’ hat. She doesn’t remember the exact dates, or the exact events. But she can feel it in the air. She knows something’s coming. She brought home two Mahsa Jina Amini T-shirts from one of the protests. She hung one in our living room, and the other in our bedroom. I can not fight it, her word is law. Lately she has become obsessed with the idea of going back to Iran. She thinks we’re going home. She’s always saying: Where are we going to live? Who are we going to see? It’s not a delusion. The hope is inside her. And is inside of me too. I still hope that I will live to see it. The new Iran. Just a glimpse would be enough for me. As Ferdowsi writes: ‘Even a few drops sipped at the end of evil, is worth more than all the years of life.” \n\nدر هشتاد‌سالگی در رسانه‌ای فارسی‌زبان سخن می‌گفتم. می‌خواستم بِیتی از شاهنامه را بخوانم، زمانی که رستم رخش را برمی‌گزیند؛ نتوانستم آن بیت را به یاد آورم. نزدیک به یک دقیقه خاموش بودم. پس از آن، سخنرانی‌ و مصاحبه را کنار گذاشتم. اکنون در دوران تازه‌ای هستم. این را پذیرفته‌ام. مانند تیری‌ست که از کمان رها شده و در حال فرود آمدن است. پروازی درازآهنگ بوده و کمابیش به هدف رسیده است. آنچه را در توانم بوده انجام داده‌ام. در تلاشم تا با جان و روان مردم‌مان بیامیزم. اکنون همه چیز در دست جوانان است. نیرومندان دلیر. آنان می‌توانند رژیم را براندازند. در بزرگ‌ترین نبردهای شاهنامه، تا زمانی که درفش افراشته باشد، سپاه نیرومند و استوار می‌ماند. درفش باید برافراشته بماند. درفش بر زمین افتاده، نشان آشکار شکست است. درفش این رژیم حجاب است، تا یاد دارم چنین بوده است. تا بتوانند از آن نمی گذرند. دیدنی‌ست. نمادی‌ست که از دوردست پیداست. هر اندازه هم در حال غرق شدن باشند، هر اندازه هم ناتوان شده باشند، این نماد نمایش بودن آنهاست. می پندارند که  نیمی از ایرانیان را زیر فرمان دارند. آن را درفش خود کرده‌اند. روز نبرد فرا رسیده است. کاخ‌شان محاصره شده‌ است. درفش با شتاب در حال افتادن است. هنگامی که سرانجام بر زمین افتد، رژیم نابود خواهد شد. من و میترا به تظاهرات می‌رویم. او همواره کلاه «زن، زندگی، آزادی»‌اش را بر سر ‌دارد. شاید تاریخ‌ها و مناسبت‌ها را دقیق به یاد نیاورد اما هوای دگرگونی را احساس می‌کند. دو پیراهن با چهره‌ی زیبای مهسا ژینا امینی را از تظاهراتی به خانه آورد. یکی را بر دیوار اتاق نشیمن آویخت و دیگری را بر دیوار اتاق‌مان. و من با او اختلافی ندارم زیرا که سخن او قانون است. تازگی حسی نیرومند برای برگشتن به خانه و میهن دارد. همواره می‌پرسد: “کجا زندگی خواهیم کرد؟ چه کسانی را خواهیم دید؟ به دیدن چه جاهایی خواهیم رفت؟” این خیال نیست؛ امید در درون او شعله‌ور شده است و همچنین در جان من. امیدوارم که تا آن روز زنده بمانیم. فردوسی می‌گوید: دَمی آب خوردن پسِ بدسَگال / به از عُمرِ هفتاد و هشتاد سال",

  "text": "(49/54) “We still take long walks together, even today. There’s a path through the forest near our house. Mitra still can’t stand the silence. She’ll walk off the path so she can hear the dry crunch of the leaves. She still talks the entire time, but these days our conversations don’t reach back as far as they used to. We mainly talk about the things we see. She’ll count her steps, count the houses, count the trees. Mitra’s memory is no longer her friend; it no longer supports her. But she still says ‘hello’ to everyone that she sees. And she’s still a queen, I am always at her service. These days we have become inseparable. If I do not see her for two minutes, I will find what room she’s in. I button her jacket. I tie her shoes. I handle all her medications. I do not grieve the situation. I feel gratitude that I am able to do these things for her, despite nature. My only grief is for her. Her memory was her greatest gift. It’s where I stored my treasures. I could tell her any verse, even once. And she could remember it forever. Now it will escape her after only a minute. Every day her world gets smaller and smaller. Tighter and tighter. It’s the oldest memories that she remembers most now. Recently she has been fixated on her hand. She keeps holding up her crippled hand, and asking: ‘Why did you ever marry me?’ When we were young in Tehran, her father had a tradition. Every morning he would insist on having the first cup of tea. He said it was the one that tasted best. He called it ‘the flower of the tea.’ So now when I brew our tea every morning, I will wait. Until Mitra is up. Until she’s ready. So that I can serve her the flower of the tea. Then as soon as we’ve finished the kettle, she’ll make me go outside. And pour the remains on the roots of our trees.” \n\nما همچنان با هم به پیاده‌روی‌های درازآهنگ می‌رویم. راهی جنگلی در نزدیکی خانه‌مان هست. میترا همچنان خاموشی را برنمی‌تابد. هنوز  به راه رفتن روی برگ‌های خُشک و شنیدن خِش‌خِش آنها ‌دلبسته است. هنوز همه‌ی  راه را سخن می‌گوید، اما گفت‌وگوهای ما به گذشته‌های دور بازنمی‌گردند. این روزها بیشتر درباره‌ی آنچه می‌بینیم، سخن می‌گوییم. او گام‌هایش را می‌شمارد، خانه‌ها را می‌شمارد و درخت‌ها را. حافظه‌ی میترا دیگر یاری‌اش نمی‌دهد، دوستش نیست، از او کناره گرفته است. ولی هنوز با هر رهگذری که از کنارمان می‌گذرد، خوش‌آمد می‌گوید. او هنوز شهبانوی خانه است و خواهد ماند و تا هستم او را پرستار و خدمتگزار خواهم بود. این روزها ما جدایی‌ناپذیریم. اگر برای دو دقیقه او را نبینم، در اتاق‌ها به دنبالش می‌گردم. دکمه‌های ژاکت و بند کفش‌هایش را می‌بندم. داروهایش را به هنگام به او می‌رسانم. هرگز برای خودم دل نمی‌سوزانم. سپاسگزار بختم که می‌توانم اين کارها را برای او انجام دهم. برای او اندوهناکم. برجسته‌ترین توانایی او حافظه‌اش بود. یاد او گنجینه‌ی یادهای من هم بود. می‌دانستم هر بیتی را یک بار برای او بخوانم، برای همیشه به یاد می‌سپارد. این روزها پس از دقیقه‌ای از ذهن او می‌گریزند. دنیایش هر روز کوچک‌ و کوچک‌تر، تنگ‌ و تنگ‌تر می‌شود. خاطره‌های دوردست را بهتر به یاد دارد. تازگی‌ها به دست چپش می‌اندیشد. پیوسته دست کم‌کار خود را بالا نگه می‌دارد و می‌پرسد: \"به راستی تو چرا با من ازدواج کردی؟\" روزگار جوانی که در تهران بودیم، پدرش دوست داشت هر بامداد، نخستین استکان چای را بنوشد، می‌گفت بهترین است. آن را «گُلِ چای» می‌نامید. هنگامی که هر بامداد چای‌مان را آماده می‌کنم، چشم‌به‌راهش می‌مانم تا بتوانم با گُلِ چای از او پذیرایی کنم. شب‌ها دست مرا می‌گیرد تا با هم تَه‌مانده‌ی چای را پای گل‌ها ودرختان بریزیم",

  "text": "(48/54) “I didn’t raise them to be Iranian first. Above all I wanted them to be good people. I wanted the same things for them that I want for all people: to do the next right thing, to say the next true thing. But they were growing up in tough times. So many bad things were being done in the name of Iranians. I wanted them to know the real Iran. I wasn’t able to bring them there, but I did try to build a little Iran around us. I’ve surrounded us with my memories of home. On the wall hangs a painting of Nahavand that I made in Germany. Above the back door hangs the horns of the first ibex I ever hunted. On the shelf in the dining room is my jar of soil. It was collected from a spot in Nahavand at the base of the mountain, right at the source of the spring. And next to my jar of soil, for anyone who needs it: sits my Shahnameh. As soon as they were old enough I asked each of them to memorize a verse about their namesake. Zaal went first. His namesake was one of the wisest heroes in all of Shahnameh: 𝘡𝘢𝘢𝘭 𝘬𝘯𝘦𝘸 𝘢𝘭𝘭 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨𝘴 𝘨𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘵 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘴𝘮𝘢𝘭𝘭, 𝘯𝘦𝘢𝘳 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘧𝘢𝘳. 𝘏𝘪𝘴 𝘸𝘪𝘴𝘥𝘰𝘮 𝘴𝘩𝘰𝘯𝘦 𝘢𝘴 𝘪𝘧 𝘢 𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘳. Rostam went next. He chose his verse from a part of Shahnameh when Iran finds itself in a moment of great darkness. Three enemy kings have aligned their forces. Three hundred thousand men march against us. The army is on the brink of defeat. The dirt’s turned clay with blood. Rostam arrives at the battlefield on foot: no horse, no armor, carrying nothing but a bow and arrow. He walks out to face the enemy alone. And with a single shot, he slays the greatest champion on the other side. The enemy is stunned into silence. Their courage flees them. Their commander screams: 𝘞𝘩𝘰 𝘢𝘳𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘴𝘦 𝘗𝘦𝘳𝘴𝘪𝘢𝘯𝘴? 𝘕𝘰𝘵 𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘯 𝘢 𝘭𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘤𝘰𝘶𝘭𝘥 𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘢𝘨𝘢𝘪𝘯𝘴𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘮! It’s one of my favorite verses in all of Shahnameh. My entire life, ever since I was a little boy, those have always been my favorite scenes. The ones that make me most emotional. The ones that make my voice break. When at the moment of greatest darkness, one champion makes a stand. And with a single act of courage reveals the soul of an entire people.” \n\nدر پرورش نوادگانم نکوشیدم که تنها به ایرانی‌بودن خود ببالند. می‌خواستم مردمان خوبی باشند. هر چه برای آنها آرزو می کنم، آرزوی جهانی من هم هست. ویژگی‌های فرهنگ ایرانیان جهان‌گسترانه بودن آن است. راستی را بنیاد زندگی اجتماعی بدانند. با ناراستی نمی‌توان دو تن را به هم پیوست. نیک اندیشیدن، نیکخواهانه سخن گفتن و به کارهای نیک که آبادگر جهان‌اند کوشیدن را به جان دریابند. مردمان ما در روزگار سختی بزرگ می‌شدند. رویدادهای ناگواری به نام ایرانیان نشان داده می‌شد. می‌خواستم ایران راستین را بشناسند. نمی‌توانستم آنها را به میهن‌ام ببرم، ولی تلاش کردم ایران کوچکی پیرامون خودمان بسازم. بر روی دیوار نگاره‌هایی از نهاوند است که آن را هنگام زندگی در آلمان کشیده‌ام. بالای دیوار اتاق، شاخ کَلی که شکار کردم، آویزان است. روی گنجه‌ی اتاق ناهارخوری، شیشه‌ی خاک‌ام را نهاده‌ام ،خاک نهاوند که درست از کوه‌پایه گردآوری شده است، از سرچشمه. در کنار شیشه‌ی خاک‌ام، برای هر کس بخواهد شاهنامه‌ام را. از آن هنگام که به سن درک و فهم رسیدند، از آنها خواستم که هر یک بیتی را در پیوند با نامشان برگزینند. نخست زال آغاز کرد. نام او برگرفته از یکی از خردمندترین پهلوانان شاهنامه است. زال همه چیزهای بزرگ و کوچک، و دور و نزدیک را می‌دانست. خرد او چونان ستاره‌ای می‌درخشید. سپس نوبت رستم بود. بیت‌اش از بخشی از شاهنامه است که ایران در هنگامه‌ی جانشکاری‌ست. سه پادشاه دشمن به هم پیوسته‌اند. سیسدهزار مرد جنگی رو یاروی ایرانیان ایستاده‌اند. سپاه در آستانه‌ی شکست است. خاک آغشته به خون است. رستم تازان می‌رسد، سم اسبش کوفته است، پیاده به رزمگاه می‌رود، آری، بی اسب، بی جنگ‌افزار، تنها با تیر و کمانی. او به تنهایی با دشمن روبه رو می‌شود، تنها با یک تیر، سردار بزرگ سپاه دشمن را از پای در می‌آورد. دشمن شگفت‌زده به خاموشی فرو می‌رود. دلاوری آنها به یکباره رنگ می‌بازد. فرمانده آنها بُهت‌زده می‌گوید: تو گفتی که لَختی فُرومایه‌اند / ز گردنکشان کمترین پایه‌اند / کُنون نیزه با تیر ایشان یکی‌ست / دل شیر در جنگشان اندکی‌ست. در تمام دوران زندگی‌ام، از آن هنگام که پسر‌بچه‌ای بیش نبودم، چنین صحنه‌هایی مورد علاقه‌ام بوده‌اند. صحنه‌هایی که بیش از همه‌ احساس مرا برمی‌انگیزند. پهنه‌هایی که مایه‌ی لرزش صدایم می‌شوند. زمانی که گُردی ایرانی به پا می‌ایستد و با کاری دلیرانه، همه‌ی جان و‌ روان ملت‌اش را آشکار می‌سازد",

  "text": "\"I was 33, happily married with a beautiful young son and living a normal life, until one day in 2019 I was diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma, a rare blood cancer. It felt like life had punched me hard in the face, and my first reaction was denial. The doctor said 'We need to start your treatment asap. This cancer causes bone fractures. There's no cure, but with chemotherapy and then stem cell transplants, the malignant cells can be kept under control for a few to several years.' I was also told that the treatment might mean I couldn't bear any more children. The chemo was very tough. I have thin veins so I dreaded every time they tried to find a decent one to put the needle in, and I couldn't spend much time with our son because I was so tired and nauseous, with bad headaches and no appetite. The silver lining was that as a family we became so much closer. My husband stood by me, he was always listening, and he showered me with so much love. And one day, when I was just crying with mental and physical exhaustion, my mom hugged me tight and said 'I can feel your pain. I wish I could take it in me instead of you.' That's unconditional love.\n\n\"Then I started reading a book called Wabi Sabi and came across this Japanese phrase ‘ichigo ichie' (itch-ee-go itch-ee-ay). It means 'one time one meeting’ - that we only get one chance to live every moment, and if we let it slip away it’s lost forever. Somehow this really chimed with me. It made me realise that every moment I live is unique and unrepeatable, and that nothing is permanent - including my pain. Instead of just existing, I started living again. Instead of dwelling on my past or future, I started making the most of my present, immersing myself in each moment, which has made me so much happier, more grateful and compassionate. As David Levien says 'At the end, one didn't remember life as a whole but as just a string of moments.' The only thing we have is NOW.\"\n\nPreeti photographed on Parliament Hill by her friend Soumya Kavi. \n\nMore in the comments below...",

  "text": "(2/2) “The beauty is that when I did have children it all just felt so natural. I was so fascinated by them for the first weeks and months that I barely slept. I was just staring at them, thinking 'Wow - you came out of me, I made you!' Because I doted on them, and it was just so amazing and I was so consumed by these feelings, it made my wonder how my mother couldn't have felt the same. How can you not? And I wanted to give everything to get this right. I felt 'You're here, and you're my responsibility. How can I build you to be the best that you can be?' So for the first couple of years I did totally abandon the life that I knew before and pretty much shut myself off from the outside world. My world was playgroups, walks, swimming with them. I also read books and took courses about childhood - one I absolutely loved was called ‘Strength in family, strength in community’. I was just totally immersed in motherhood. Of course I did get invited to things, but I just wanted to zone and hone in, and really know what I was doing before I felt the freedom to incorporate a little bit of my old life. There came a point where I couldn’t remember what I’d done or who I was before I had my children. I had to relearn the things I enjoyed again, and how to look after myself too.\n\n“But the confidence I felt, being a mum, was so much stronger than being a girl or a woman or a daughter or a sister or even a wife. That was me. It defined me. I'd finally found the thing that I was great at. It was also the first time I could remember my parents saying 'I'm proud of you'. That was a big uplift, a real 'Wow' moment too. It was my dad who taught me the importance of books. He said ‘a book can take you anywhere in the world!’ So I’ve always encouraged my children to read, and now they’re both bookworms like me. They’ll read literally anything, right across the board, which is pretty awesome. I’m loving it, every minute, every second, of being a mum, and I’m really aware that they’re mine now, but they’ll belong to society after, where they’ll either be a blessing or a curse.” \n\nLinda and Eliza, met met at this year's Queen's Park Book Festival.\n\n(More in the comments below)",

  "text": "(1/2) “I always knew that I wanted children, but I was also terrified to, because I couldn't bear the idea of being a terrible parent. I knew it came with such a serious level of responsibility and I didn't want to mess up. My own upbringing was not ideal - there was a lot of pressure on me and my brother to excel academically, and very little family time, or care or love or pride expressed. Then, when I was 15, I met Hugo, my husband and my children’s father. We lived across the road from each other, and we were best friends, playing peekaboo from behind the curtains, watching movies and talking endlessly about everything, for 2 years before we got together. All the things I wasn't given he was, so that became a healing journey for me. Being shown a lot of love meant he knew how, physically and emotionally, and was able to show it too. I didn't even know how to hug properly until I met him - there was hardly any touching at all in my family. Where I grew up never hearing words like 'I love you' or 'You're amazing', not even for Christmas, he was very happy to say those words, and show me and make me believe that that was true. So he helped me to see the things that I was rather than that I wasn’t.\n\n“I’m coming up to 36 now. Obviously we were teenagers when we first got together, and over the years we've changed and grown, become different people. So it's about whether you can still fit together, and still love each other when you're not the same. We both know that good relationships take effort, and some selflessness. It’s not all skipping down the street hand-in-hand. We also had a shared sense that we didn't have the ideal upbringing, that we wanted to create something new for our children. Hugo would like to have had more discipline. He was spoilt rotten, the king of his world, adored by all his big, extended family - grandparents, aunties, uncles, cousins. There was none of this academic pressure to be the genius, the professor, and he wishes he'd had more of that push, then he might have gone further in school. But he did have an abundance of love, in all sorts of ways, and he helped me trust that we would be great parents.\" \n\nLinda, met at this year's Queen's Park Book Festival (1/2)\n\n(More in the comments below...)",

  "text": "(47/54) “When our grandchildren were born we moved to America to help raise them. First came Ahang’s son Sepanta. Then when I turned sixty we moved into Maziar’s house to help raise his newborn twin boys. And that’s where we’ve been for the last thirty years. The year that we moved in Mitra made me swear an oath. She made me promise that I would die before her, because she couldn’t stand the thought of me being with another woman. Maziar and his wife were doing their medical residency at the time, so most nights we were on our own. Because of Mitra’s hand injury, much of the childcare fell to me. I’d be up all night with one baby in each arm: this one needs a bottle, that one needs a diaper change. When the boys grew a bit older Mitra took over the clothing decisions. She was determined for them to have matching bathrobes. She couldn’t find the exact ones she wanted in America, so she ordered fancy bathrobes from Europe. I was responsible for the physical activities: the wrestling, the hiking, the fishing. In our backyard we built a small garden, and in their quieter moments they would help me tend it. But my most important job was teaching them our language. The vessel of our culture. I wanted to lead them to the source of the spring, so that they could read the words our writers have written. And sing the songs our singers have sung. The Persian alphabet can be difficult, so I didn’t start with letters. I started with words. I chose three hundred words. Simple words, words that everyone should know: 𝘔𝘦𝘩𝘳. Love. 𝘙𝘢𝘴𝘵𝘪. Truth. 𝘕𝘦𝘦𝘬𝘪. Goodness. While we were working in the garden, I’d say them over and over. It didn’t matter to me if anyone was listening or paying attention. All that mattered was that the words were being spoken. Every time we took a long trip in the car, I’d prompt them with the same question: What are the two things that God has given everyone? 𝘑𝘢𝘢𝘯 and 𝘒𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘥. Soul and Wisdom.” \n\nبه آمریکا آمدیم تا در نگهداری نوه‌هایمان کمک کنیم. نخست پسر آهنگ سپنتا به دنیا آمد. شش سال در خانه‌ی آنها ماندیم. با سپنتا از آن روزها خاطرات بسیار شیرین دارم که به هنگام به آنها خواهم پرداخت .سپس به خانه‌ی مازیار رفتیم تا در نگهداری از دوقلوها یاری‌شان دهیم. آنها برای گذراندن دوره‌ی تخصصی پزشکی به سختی درگیر بودند. میترا مرا سوگند می‌داد که پیش از او بمیرم، زیرا  مرا تنها برای خود می‌خواست، من هم همین را می‌خواستم. بسیاری از شبها تنها بودیم. یک شب هر دو کشیک داشتند، شب دیگر هر دو به خانه می‌آمدند و دو شب دیگر یکی‌شان در خانه می‌خوابید. به دلیل آسیب‌دیدگی دست میترا، بخش بیشتری از  پرستاری آنها با من بود. بنابراین شب‌ها را با هر نوزادی در یک دستم می‌گذراندم، یکی نیاز به شیشه‌ی شیر داشت، دیگری به تعویض پوشَک. هنگامی که پسرها بزرگتر شدند میترا بیشتر مرا کمک می‌کرد. او می‌خواست که آنها کُت‌های حوله‌ای مشابه داشته باشند. در آمریکا فرهنگ کُت حوله‌ای وجود نداشت، بنابراین از اروپا سفارش داد. فعالیت‌های ورزشی آنها با من بود: کُشتی، پیاده‌روی، ماهی‌گیری. در حیاط پشت خانه باغچه‌ی کوچکی، به اندازه‌ی نخستین باغچه‌ام در نهاوند راه انداختیم. گاهی مرا در پیرایش باغچه کمک می‌کردند. اما مهمترین مسئولیتم را در آموختن زبان فارسی به آنها می‌دانستم. زبان نگهدارنده‌ی فرهنگ است. می‌خواستم آنها را به سرچشمه‌ی آگاهی‌ها برسانم و با ارزش زبان پارسی آشنا کنم تا بتوانند خودشان واژگانی را که نویسندگان‌ و سرایندگان ما نوشته‌اند بخوانند. تا بتوانند ترانه‌ها و سرودهای خوانندگان‌مان را زمزمه کنند. یادگیری الفبای فارسی شاید کمی مشکل باشد، از این رو با الفبا شروع نکردم. از واژه‌ها آغاز کردم. سیسد واژه انتخاب کردم. واژگانی ساده که هر کس باید بداند: مهر، راستی، نیکی. هنگامی که مشغول کار در باغچه  بودیم، آنها را بارها تکرار می‌کردم. مهم نبود که کسی گوش می‌دهد یا نه. تنها چیزی که مهم بود این بود که واژگان گفته و شنیده شوند. هرگاه سوار خودرو می‌شدیم، این پرسش را تکرار می‌کردم: “بهترین دو چیزی که خدا به همه داده است چیست؟” جان و خرد",

  "text": "(46/54) “There was nothing I could do. It was like watching a child fall from the roof of a building. I could only look on in agony. When I arrived in Germany there were two million unemployed. It was years before I could find a job. Resistance takes resources: you must travel, you must speak, you must organize. I just didn’t have the means. I moved into a small apartment with my daughter Ahang. I’d spend all day listening to the radio for news reports about Iran. I kept hoping that it would be over in an instant. That a dam would break, and everyone would say at the same time: ‘This is not working for us.’ But that moment never came. The grief would not leave me. I wrote poems about Iran. I taught myself to paint, and I painted paintings of Iran. All day I’d pace back and forth in the living room. I’d talk to myself like a madman: ‘How did we fall into this deep pit? How can we get out again?’ I can’t explain it. It’s an irrational love, an illogical love. I don’t know where it comes from. It begins before my memory. There’s so much to love about Iran. It’s so many things: it’s a land, it’s a people, it’s a culture, it’s a story, it’s a myth. But it’s not something you can hold. Through it all, my greatest grief was for Mitra. Less than a month after I left the country, another war started. Iraq invaded Iran, and the borders were closed for four years. Four years without seeing her. She’d write me letters every day. She’d tell me every little thing. One year she sent me a calendar, and she’d written me a love poem from a different poet on every page. Telephones were tough to come by, but she always found a way to call. Mostly we would share news. But we still found time to read each other poetry. It is said that at any given time there are one hundred thousand poets in Iran, and I am not one of them. But in Germany I finally wrote her some poetry of my own: 𝘐 𝘸𝘪𝘴𝘩 𝘥𝘦𝘴𝘵𝘪𝘯𝘺 𝘥𝘪𝘥𝘯’𝘵 𝘥𝘦𝘮𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘥𝘪𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘯𝘤𝘦 / 𝘐 𝘸𝘪𝘴𝘩 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘸𝘦𝘳𝘦 𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘦 /𝘠𝘰𝘶𝘳 𝘨𝘦𝘯𝘵𝘭𝘦 𝘩𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘤𝘢𝘳𝘦𝘴𝘴𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘮𝘺 𝘧𝘢𝘤𝘦 /𝘞𝘪𝘵𝘩𝘰𝘶𝘵 𝘺𝘰𝘶, 𝘐’𝘮 𝘢 𝘣𝘳𝘰𝘬𝘦𝘯 𝘣𝘳𝘢𝘯𝘤𝘩 / 𝘢 𝘣𝘰𝘥𝘺 𝘸𝘪𝘵𝘩𝘰𝘶𝘵 𝘢 𝘴𝘰𝘶𝘭/ 𝘢 𝘥𝘺𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘧𝘭𝘢𝘮𝘦/ 𝘞𝘪𝘵𝘩𝘰𝘶𝘵 𝘺𝘰𝘶, 𝘐’𝘮 𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘮 𝘸𝘪𝘵𝘩 𝘩𝘢𝘯𝘥𝘴 𝘣𝘰𝘶𝘯𝘥.”\n\nکاری از دستم برنمی‌آمد. تماشای افتادن کودکی از بام بود، آنهم در اندوهی سهمگین. پایداری به پول نیاز دارد و منابع مالی. باید سفر کرد، باید سخنرانی کرد، باید سازماندهی کرد. گذران یک زندگی ساده هم برایم دشوار بود. زمانی که به آلمان رسیدم، دو میلیون نفر بیکار بودند. با آهنگ همخانه شدم. او دانشجو ‌بود. آپارتمانِ اجاره‌ای کوچکی بود. سالی چند به درازا کشید تا توانستم کاری بیابم. هر آنچه در توانم بود می‌کردم. مقاله می‌نوشتم. می‌کوشیدم تا خود را از غم و اندوه برهانم. چامه‌ای چند در‌باره‌ی ایران سرودم. نقاشی را خودآموزی کردم و از ایران می‌کشیدم. اما بیشتر وقتم را به قدم زدن در اتاق نشیمن می‌گذراندم. از گوشه‌ای به گوشه‌ای قدم می‌زدم، و ساعت‌ها ادامه می‌یافت. یادمان‌ها را می‌کاویدم تا دریابم: “چگونه در این گودال ژرف فُرو افتادیم؟ چگونه می‌شود دوباره بیرون آییم؟” این درد مرا آسوده نمی‌گذاشت. انگیزه‌ی دلبستگی‌ها را شناختن آسان نیست. آبشخورش کجاست؟ عشق است و عشق پدیده‌ای ناشناخته است، منطقی‌نیست، غریزی‌ست. پیش از یاد‌ها آغاز می‌شود. ایران پدیده‌ی ساده‌ای نیست، پیچیده و تو در تو ‌ست، خاک است، مردم است، فرهنگ است، داستان است، اسطوره است. عشقی‌ بی‌پایان است. مادر است، پدر است، خواهران و برادران است، دوستان است. همه چیز است. بی او چیزی نیستم! در کنار اینها و فراتر از آنها، میترا بود. کمتر از یک ماه از رفتن‌ام نگذشته بود که صدام حسین به خاک ایران تجاوز کرد. مرزها بسته شدند. هر روز نامه می‌نوشت. از تمام جزئیات با من سخن می‌گفت. یک سال، تقویمی برایم فرستاد که بر هر برگ آن سالشمار شعری عاشقانه از هر شاعری که می‌شناخت با خط خوش نوشته بود. در آن زمان تماس‌های تلفنی بسیار دشوار بود. او همیشه راهی پیدا می‌کرد و گفت‌وگو می‌کردیم. بیشتر وقتها خبرها را به هم می‌دادیم. اما گاهی هم شعری برای هم می‌خواندیم. گویند سدهزار شاعر همزمان در ایران هستند. من یکی از آنها نیستم ولی در آلمان بِیتی چند برایش نوشتم: بی تو‌ دامادِ خُفته در کفَنَم / بی تو افسُرده‌جان و خَسته‌تَنم / بی تو آسودگی کُجا با من / همه با درد و رنج همسُخنم / بی تو از هم گُسسته در زنجیر / چشمِ تاریک و خسته را مانَم / بی تو پایِ شکسته اَندر گِل / رُستَمِ دَست‌بَسته را مانَم",

  "text": "(45/54) A jar of soil. That’s all I have left of my home. It’s good soil. A guidebook once called Nahavand ‘a piece of heaven, fallen to earth.’ But there’s blood in the soil too. There have been more wars on Iran’s soil than any other country. We’ve had more battles, more bloodshed, more defeats than any other people. And this has been one of the worst of them. The people who stayed in Iran tried their best. But one by one they fell: anyone who stepped out, anyone who spoke up, anyone who said: ‘This is not working for us.’ They were silenced. It was a savage violence. A violence from fourteen hundred years ago. From the moment of those very first executions on the roof of the school, there has been no coherence. No 𝘥𝘢𝘢𝘥. The smallest act could lead to death: a blog post, a sign at a protest, a few strands of hair showing beneath a headscarf. The regime needs fear to stay in control. And for fear to spread, the violence must be random. So that everyone thinks: ‘I could be next. It could happen to me.’ They’ve turned the country into a dark forest. When there is light, when there is law, when there is 𝘥𝘢𝘢𝘥, you know where danger comes from. You can keep away from it. But in the dark danger can come from anywhere, at any time. Parvaneh stayed. The young woman from 𝘕𝘪𝘳𝘰𝘰. The one with the strongest voice. She tried to work for change within the country. In an interview she told a reporter: ‘Iranians abroad can provide spiritual support, but the front must emerge from within Iran.’ She kept writing. She kept speaking out. She kept fighting for political freedom. Only now she was fighting for one-tenth the freedoms that she had before. One night the intelligence services broke into her home. They stabbed her to death, alongside her husband. Dariush was a tall man, much bigger than Parvaneh. But they stabbed her twice as many times. Either they hated her twice as much, or she fought them twice as hard.”\n\nشیشه‌ای خاک است، از خانه‌ام ایران. همه‌ی آنچه از زادگاهم برایم مانده است. خاک خوبی‌ست. خاک نهاوند. زمانی کتاب ایران‌گردی آن را “پاره‌ای از بهشت بر زمین افتاده\" نامیده بود. خون بسیارانی با آن خاک درآمیخته است. خاک ایران بیش از هر سرزمین دیگری درگیر جنگ و ستیز بوده است. ما بیش از هر ملتی نبردها، پیروزی‌ها و شکست‌ها داشته‌ایم. اما این یکی از بدترین‌ها بود. مردمی که در ایران ماندند، تلاش‌ خود را کردند. ولی آنان را یکی پس از دیگری از میان برداشتند: هر کس پا پیش نهاد، پرسشی کرد، هر کس گفت: “این برای ما کارآمد نیست.” همه را خاموش کردند. خشونت دهشتناکی بود. خشونتی برآمده از هزار و چهارسد سال پیش. از آن دم که نخستین اعدام‌ها بر پشت بام آن مدرسه آغاز شد، بیداد پهلوان میدان بود. کمترین‌ جنبش مرگ‌آور بود: یک پُست وبلاگی، یک پوستر اعتراض، چند تار مو که از زیر روسری نمایان باشد. رژیم می‌داند که خشونت باید ناگهانی و بی‌دلیل باشد تا ترس همه‌گیر شود. تا همه بپندارند: “شاید نفر بعدی باشم. این رویداد برای من هم رخ خواهد داد.” کشور را جنگلی تاریک کرده‌اند. هنگامی که روشنایی باشد، هنگامی که قانون باشد، هنگامی که داد باشد، خطر را می‌توان شناخت. تاریکی اما از هر سو و هر آن تو را غافلگیر خواهد کرد. پروانه ماند. جوان‌ترین عضو نیرو. آنکه رساترین صدا را داشت. ضد شاه بود. از اینرو فکر می‌کرد در امان است، تلاش کرد از درون کشور تغییر ایجاد کند. به روزنامه‌نگاری گفته بود: “ایرانیان خارج  از کشور می‌توانند پشتیبان معنوی باشند، اما کارزار می‌بایستی در درون پا بگیرد.” به نوشتن و سخن گفتن ادامه داد. به نبرد برای آزادی، برای یک دهم آزادی‌هایی که پیش از این داشت! یک شب دژخیمان رژیم اهریمنی به خانه‌شان ریختند. او و همسرش، داریوش فروهر را با زخم کارد کشتند. داریوش مردی بلند‌‌بالا و بسیار نیرومندتر از پروانه بود. پروانه را دو برابر او زخم زده بودند. یا کینه‌شان به او دو برابر بود، یا او دو برابر پایداری کرده بود",

  "text": "“I was born in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, to a 19-year old student who was unable to look after me. A family took me in as a 2-month-babe and raised me lovingly. This book is the story of my adoptive father’s life and one of my proudest possesions. As an army general, he led Mongolia’s troops as they protected our border with China. When a medical family friend noticed that I didn’t react to sounds behind me, my parents took me to a doctor who confirmed my deafness. That’s how I got support so early. They improvised home signs, drew pictures, wrote things down. Mongolia is a beautiful country but very sparsely populated with only 3 million people. Most deaf people are isolated in remote towns and villages, or live in nomadic tribes constantly on the move. Fortunately for me, Ulaanbaatar is a modern capital city so it has a deaf school - the only one in Mongolia. When I was 6 and my parents took me there, I was amazed to see all the children signing to each other! \n\n“In my mid-20s, my sister emigrated to England to study and work for the United Nations, so I took the plunge along with my adoptive mother and my 4-year-old daughter and joined her. I was stunned by the access for British deaf people - TV subtitles, text telephones, sign language interpreters! I looked after Mum when she had cancer, and for years took any job I could find – from hotel cleaning to care work – to pay the rent. But we Mongolians are resilient. We’re used to tough conditions and we don’t give in easily. I took classes in English, Maths and BSL at City Lit college, where the deaf teachers were wonderful, I made new friends in the deaf community, and I became more confident about life here. For the past 7 years, I’ve been a Learning Support Assistant at Oak Lodge School for Deaf Children in Wandsworth. My only criticism of Ulaanbaatar’s deaf school is that all the teachers were hearing - there just aren’t enough adult deaf role models working in deaf schools! That’s why I’m proud of my current role. Our pupils all have such different abilities, but I encourage each one to be the best they can be and to be kind to others.”\n\nMashbekh, photographed by Stephen Iliffe  for his project Deaf Mosaic.",

  "text": "\"During periods of high emotional activity it's always literature I turn to. When my younger sister, who was a much older soul than me and my elder brother, died of cancer at the age of 23, poetry really soothed the heartbreak, as did taking my parents' dog on 6-hour walks. It also created a direct connection and empathy with others which I've not found in any other art form. When I came out as gay at 21 was another point when I found I really needed books, because I had to get over my own homophobia and find a way to accept myself as Nature had made me. So I read a lot of works by writers like Alan Hollinghurst and Colm Tóibín, and the autobiography of Anthony Sher who always struggled with it in himself. 'We read to know we're not alone' is so true.\n\n\"Last year I was reading in Queen's Park one beautiful summer's afternoon, surrounded by 2-foot-high grass and feeling as if I was in a meadow, and I thought 'This would be an amazing place for a book festival!' Then I discovered there had actually been a book festival here in 2011 and 2012 which was very well received, but the person organising it had left. So I decided it I just had to do it again and the response has been absolutely wonderful. People don't naturally reject culture. It starts, I think, by culture rejecting them, if there's not a structure in place where people can engage deeply with it. They don't feel confident about having their own response to, or free to like or dislike, a book or a piece of art or music, and then they reject it. So I'm really proud that we're creating a high-quality, sustainable and accessible annual literary festival, with lots of world-class writers but which is also a celebration of the talents and literature of the local community. Hopefully it will introduce many more people to the joys of reading for years to come.\" \n\nTom, photographed at his flat in Queens Park. \n\n------------------------------\n\nThrowback to May 2018 ahead of Tom's very first Queen's Park Book Festival in June. I photographed that, and the 2nd one in 2019, so I know it's a truly wonderful celebration of the written word. The 3rd one is happening this coming weekend - https://qpbookfest.com/",

So many people know so much more than they used to just a couple of years ago, and it is really frightening not to be able to ignore the crisis that we’re accelerating towards. I’ve been protesting for the climate movement since I was 15 and I feel that what we have to do now is immediate and direct actions. It’s clear that the marches have not been enough. We need to be more impactful to ensure people realise how extreme it is. We have to persevere and we can’t let burn-out stop us. I have a lot more perseverance and determination than I expected. Even carrying on through burn out, when you feel like what you’re doing has no impact?

  "text": "“I had a very happy childhood, growing up in Turin with the most inspiring, supportive and loving parents. My dad lost his arms and sight at only 8 years old during World War II, but he is a man of remarkable strength. He became a philosophy professor and was also very involved in social work. I saw him as a super-hero. His extraordinary courage and commitment was a profound example to me, and always made me want to do and be more. So I was horribly confused by the laughing reactions of schoolfriends. I started to feel a certain heaviness in living and would wonder at the apparent lightness of others. Then, in 2018, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. \n\n“I'd been quite successful at school, academically, and I'd long had this dream of coming to the UK to study at a top university. But in the first year of my Biomedical Sciences degree at UCL I almost gave up. I was surrounded by all these very smart students and constantly feeling inadequate. As exam season approached, I found myself on this rollercoaster of wild excitement to paralysing depression and back again, and I went home feeling defeated. But after I'd changed doctor and medications, and learned to adapt to their awful side-effects (like serious weight gain, memory loss and sleep deprivation), I came back to uni where I found the staff at UCL incredibly supportive. To be honest, the pandemic really helped me too, because it gave me so much more flexibility, listening to lectures in my own time and doing exams through coursework instead of in a room filled with pressure and anxiety. Last month I graduated from UCL with a First Class Honours, and now I’m proud of my resilience and that the pain was not all for nothing. I'll be soon be starting an MSc in Translational Neuroscience at Imperial College London, to explore further the human mind and its quirks. In ‘The Unbearable Lightness Of Being’ Milan Kundera writes that ‘The heavier the burden, the closer our lives come to the earth, the more real and truthful they become.’ Now I embrace my heaviness and I’m hopeful about my future.”\n\nAglaia, photographed in Notting Hill.\n\n[See also her words in the comments below]",

  "text": "\"I've suffered with anxiety for most of my life. It started after we lost my mum when I was 10. My dad was struggling to go to work and my brother and I were put into a home. I got myself into a bit of trouble with truancy and drugs, and they thought I might be dyslexic and on the autism spectrum too, but I managed to get a degree in business management, and for the past 36 years I've worked for Land Rover. Finding music in the early 2000s was what really gave me a sense of purpose though. A friend encouraged me to have a go at karaoke and when I finally plucked up enough courage to sing ‘A Bittersweet Symphony’ by The Verve people seemed to really enjoy it. So I decided to get some guitar and singing lessons and seemed to pick it up quite easily. I’ve formed a few bands since. Nothing majorly successful but a lot of fun. I’ve learned that when I’m doing something creative - whether it's music, landscaping, decorating - I feel calmer and more balanced. My partner works in mental health, so she really helps me too. If things get bad, I’ll go and have another counselling session. I’ve learnt to be quite open about it. \n\n\"In March 2020 I met this little lady Grace at a gig. She was singing and I thought she was fantastic, but as soon as she finished she ran offstage crying. Her mum explained she has autism, and that to sing in front of a crowd like that was a really big thing for her. I was touched. I could see her talent needed nurturing, and her mum said any help at all would be great. So I started giving Grace some lessons, initially for free. Sometimes when I’m teaching her she’ll dive off down this side path. I just try to follow because I trust that she’s trying to show me something that links to whatever I’m trying to teach her. It seems to be going really well and I'm finding it so rewarding. She's really helped me get through the lockdowns because obviously I’ve not been able to gig with my band, so teaching her has been a creative outlet. I also think we’ve anchored each other. We share an energy and it works. I’m starting to think I might teach guitar more in the future, particularly to youngsters with special needs.\"\n\nKevin, phone-HoGLed by Beth.",

  "text": "\"I'm a professional dancer and ballet teacher, but writing is something that's always been in me. When I was a kid I had a typewriter, and when I was 9 I tried to write a musical based on the 1966 comedy 'Carry On Screaming'. I took English Lit as an after-school subject, despite being told I was too stupid, and actually got a B. I’ve written at various points ever since - most notably as Music Editor for an online LGBTQ magazine which sadly no longer exists. But I've never considered myself good enough to be a 'writer', and the 'great novel' I was expecting to flow out of me never came. \n\n\"I'm 5 foot 8 and when I started dancing professionally I was only 8 stone, so not looking butch enough for lots of auditions, even when they loved my dancing. Sadly the dance industry is still quite binary and a bit of a cattle market. Now I'm a lot stockier with a massive beard I'd probably find dance work more easily. But I ended up running a craft beer bar instead. I really enjoyed it and felt that the people I worked with and for were my friends. But one day I got called in, told they didn't want me to work there any more, and given no reason. That kind of broke my heart, particularly as I'd never been let go from a job before. Then the pandemic struck, we went into lockdown, and I was stuck home alone with nothing to do and no-one to cook for. I’ve always loved cooking and being experimental in the kitchen, and becoming vegan 2 years ago, which finally cured my IBS, made me experiment even more. Last year my parents went vegan too, to try and ease Dad's arthritis. They'd seen how much it's helped me and what great alternatives to meat and dairy there are these days. Lots of people go vegan for health reasons, then they learn how much damage is being done to the environment by the meat and dairy industries and it becomes an ethical thing too. But I hate cooking just for myself. So I started writing my recipes down as a way of cooking virtually for other people. Now, thanks to the wonders of Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing, my vegan comfort-food recipe book 'Punk Junk' is out there. At the grand old age of 40 I'm officially an author!\" \n\nSimon, photographed by Paul Nicholas Dyke.",

  "text": "(44/54) \"On my final morning in Iran I woke with the sun. I knelt to the ground and prayed. It was a six mile walk to the border. The road climbed through the mountains, the same mountains that ran through Nahavand. But in Nahavand the trees were green. Here there was no life. Ferdowsi once wrote: ‘You cannot escape what is written.’ I’ve always hated that quote. There’s always a choice to be made. Just do the next right thing. That’s what I’ve always believed. Do the next right thing, say the next true thing, and a path will open up. A way will appear. I thought that we could get there. I thought that we, as a people, were going to get there. Every day we would take a step closer: more jobs, more hospitals, more schools. If only we kept choosing the next right thing, we could get there. We could build a new Iran around us. In the end light would win, as Ferdowsi writes: ‘The universe bends toward goodness.’ But you must never underestimate the forces of darkness. They can be victorious for a long time. Years. Decades. Lifetimes. Ferdowsi worked for thirty-three years. Seven verses a day. In the name of the God of Soul and Wisdom. But when he finished no one cared. Iran had been invaded once again, this time by the Turks. No one took the time to read his words. He died a broken man. Nobody heard the story of his life. Nobody heard the story of his death. He wasn’t even given a proper burial. The local cleric wouldn’t allow him to be buried in an Islamic cemetery, so they buried him in his garden. But he died with hope. Because he knew. He knew that no matter how deep they are buried, some words have wings. At the end of Shahnameh, Ferdowsi wrote: “I shall not die. These seeds I’ve sown will save my name and memory from the grave.”\n\nواپسین سپیده‌د‌مم در ایران بود. با خورشید برخاستم و نماز خواندم. تا مرز دو فرسنگ راه بود و راه مرزی از کوهستان زاگرُس می‌گذشت. همان رشته‌کوهی که از نهاوند هم می‌گذرد. ولی در نهاوند درختها سبز بودند. اینجا نشانی از زندگی ندیدم. مرز بسته و گذرگاه تهی بود. حس می‌کردم، مرگ پا به پای من می آید. فردوسی گفته بود: بکوشیم و از کوشش ما چه سود  /  کز آغاز بود آن چه بایست بود. همواره از این گفته بیزار بوده‌ام. همیشه انتخاب و گزینشی هست. هراندازه تاریک می‌نماید، کار نیکِ پیشِ رو را انجام دهیم بس است. این باور همیشگی من بوده است. اگر تنها نیک‌کردار باشیم و راستی‌ها را بازگوییم، راهی باز و گذرگاهی نمایان خواهد شد. فکر می‌کردم که می‌توانیم به آنجا برسیم. بر این باور بودم که ملت ما به آنجا خواهد رسید. هر روز یک گام و نزدیکتر خواهیم شد: پیشه‌های بیشتر، درمانگاه‌های بیشتر، آموزشگاه‌های بیشتر. اگرهمواره گزینه‌های نیکِ پیشِ رو را بر می‌گزیدیم به آنجا می‌رسیدیم، می‌توانستیم ایرانی نو پیرامون خود بسازیم. هنگامی که چشم‌اندازی بسیار تاریک هم روبه‌رویمان باشد، هنوز گزینه‌ای هست تا سرنوشت را خود ‌بنویسیم. همیشه گزینه‌ای هست. نیکی یا بدی. روشنایی یا تاریکی. فرهنگ ما نویدبخش پیروزی روشنایی بر تاریکی‌ست چنانکه فردوسی می‌سراید: که گیتی نگردد، مگر بر بهی  /  به ما بازگردد کلاه مهی. ولی هشیار باشیم، نیروی تاریکی را اندک نینگاریم! تاریکی می‌تواند زمانی دراز بپاید. سال‌ها، دهه‌ها و بیشتر. فردوسی، دلشکسته جهان را بدرود گفت. یگانه پسرش مُرده بود. ایران در نبردی دیگر شکست خورده بود. ترک‌ها اکنون کشور را زیر فرمان داشتند. سی‌وسه سال رنج او را در برآوردن آن کاخ بلند درنیافتند. گفتار نغزش ناخوانده ماند. مرد دینکار از خاکسپاری او در گورستان مسلمانان جلوگیری کرد. ناگزیر او را در باغ خانه‌اش به خاک سپردند. کسی داستان زندگی او را نشنید. کسی از مرگ‌اش آگاه نشد. بزرگمرد روزگاران این خُرسندی را داشت که سخنانش در گور نمی‌شوند، بال گشوده و پرواز می‌کنند. هرجا و هر اندازه واژگانش را در ژرفای خاک فرو برند، بال خواهند گشود و پرواز خواهند کرد. جاودان مردا، تو می‌دانستی و آنرا به زیبایی سرودی: نمیرم از این پس که من زنده‌ام  /  که تُخم سخن را پراکنده‌ام",

  "text": "(43/54) “Thirty years earlier we’d sworn an oath, to give our lives for Iran. I considered it. There was one parliamentarian who fled to the mountains and died fighting. Even with one eye, I was still a good shot. I could have made a stand. But if I gave my life, it would have to be in exchange for something. Thousands of people were dying at the time, and nothing was changing. The clerics only grew more powerful. The same slogans were being chanted in the streets. Our freedoms continued to be taken away. And then there was Mitra and the children. I couldn’t leave them behind. But with each week came more bad news: another colleague killed, another one arrested. My friends started encouraging me to leave the country, but I wouldn’t consider it. I had promised myself when I came home from Germany that I’d never leave Iran again. But even if I had wanted to, it wasn’t possible. I didn’t have a passport. I was on a list of people who were not allowed to leave the country. One afternoon we received a visit from a former colleague. He sat Mitra and I down in the living room, and he told us that he’d discovered a way to leave Iran through the Turkish border. There was a powerful family there that was known to oppose the regime. He said that the checkpoints weren’t stopping cars with families. So if Mitra rode to the border with me, I’d be able to walk the rest of the way on foot. He turned to Mitra, and said: ‘This is his final chance. If he is killed, never say that his friends abandoned him. We’ve done everything we can to convince him, so now it’s up to you.’ When he was finished, Mitra turned to me and said: ‘You must go.’ And Mitra’s word is law. We set out early in the morning. It was an eight-hour drive to the Turkish border. The entire ride was spent in silence. She kept her emotions hidden. I was a tsunami of tears. We kissed goodbye in Salmas. There was a statue of Ferdowsi in the main square.” \n\nسی سال پیش سوگندی یاد کرده بودیم که جانمان را برای ایران ببازیم. به آن اندیشیدم. نماینده‌ی مجلسی بود که به کوهستان رفته و در جنگ و گریز جان باخته بود. با داشتن یک چشم، هنوز تیرانداز خوبی بودم. می‌توانستم در درگیری ایستادگی کنم. ولی باید چیزی در برابر جان باختن بدست آورد. می‌دیدم هزاران تن به خاک افتاده‌اند. تنها بر قدرت روحانیون روز به روز افزوده می‌شد. همان شعارهای یکسان در خیابان‌ها سرداده می‌شدند. آزادی‌هایمان را یکی پس از دیگری می‌گرفتند. با میترا و فرزندانم چه می‌کردم. او را نمی‌توانستم بی پشت و پناه بگذارم. برخی دوستان مرا به ترک کشور می‌خواندند. جان بی‌بها بود. دوستانم یکی پس از دیگری دستگیر می‌شدند. یکبار هم به گزینه‌ی رفتن نیندیشیده بودم. نه، حتا یکبار. گذرنامه هم نداشتم. نامم هم در لیست ممنوع‌الخروج‌ها قرار گرفته بود. یک روز پس از نیمروز، دوست بس ارجمند سال‌هایم به خانه‌مان آمد. به گفت‌وگو نشستیم. گفت که مسیری برای ترک ایران از راه مرز ترکیه یافته است. خانواده‌ای پرنفوذ در آن ناحیه زندگی می‌کرد که مخالف رژیم بود. پلیس ‌راه خودروهایی را که با خانواده‌ سفر می‌کردند نگه نمی‌داشت. اگر میترا با من تا شهر مرزی می‌آمد، می‌توانستم بازمانده‌ی راه را پیاده بپیمایم. او به میترا گفت که این واپسین بخت است. گفت: \"ما تمام تلاش‌مان را برای راهی کردنش انجام داده‌ایم. اکنون دیگر به شما بستگی دارد. اگر ماند و کشته شد، هرگز نگویید که دوستانش او را تنها گذاشتند.\" میترا در خاموشی گوش فرا داد. هنگامی که سخن دوستم به پایان رسید، میترا رو به من کرد و گفت که باید بروی و سخنش قانون بود. سپیده‌دم راه افتادیم. سراسر راه را در خاموشی گذراندیم. او احساساتش را پنهان می‌کرد. من توفان اشک بودم. در شهر سلماس با بوسه‌ای یکدیگر را بدرود گفتیم. در میدان اصلی شهر تندیسی از فردوسی برپا بود",

  "text": "(42/54) “At dawn we woke to the sound of shots. First the machine gun fire, then the single shots. That morning I counted more than ever before: twenty-one. When the newspaper arrived that morning, I ran my finger down the list until I found his name. It has always been my belief, that if one of us could have survived, it should have been him. He could have united people. His entire life, all his thoughts, all his words, led back to one thing: our common destiny. When you only fight for one lane, one party, one policy-- all you see is conflict. Unity is so elusive. There is only one thing we all share: Iran. And nobody knew Iran more-- nobody loved Iran more-- than Dr. Ameli. We’d later learn his last words were: ‘Do not think of me, think of Iran.’ He was so brilliant. He could have earned all the money in the world. But that’s not where he stored his treasures. He chose to have less, so he could do more. And that is the rarest kind of person. There should be a statue of him in the center of Tehran. But nobody heard the story of his life. Nobody heard the story of his death. It was a seed that didn’t fall into soil. It was too dangerous to even hold a memorial service. We couldn’t grieve. We couldn’t gather together to share our memories. Our only way to honor him was to keep working, to keep resisting in whatever small way we could. We found an empty conference hall, a place so isolated that no one could hear our voices. And we’d hold meetings late at night. We’d bring in singers with beautiful voices, and they’d sing songs. Songs about loving Iran. And as people were leaving we’d hand out cassettes with the speeches of Dr. Ameli. At the very least we could spread his words. On the cover of the cassette we put a picture of his face, next to The Lion and The Sun. They’re two of the oldest symbols of Iran. The sun, the source of all light. And the lion. The lion is the most powerful animal in Iran. It’s loyal. It would do anything for its tribe. And it doesn’t run from anything. The lion is not the largest animal, but its power doesn’t come from its size. It comes from its heart. Its courage. Its soul. Its 𝘕𝘪𝘳𝘰𝘰.”\n\nپنج بامداد با شلیک مسلسل از خواب پریدم. تک‌تیرها را شمردم. از روزهای پیش بیشتر بود. ۲۱ تیر. همینکه روزنامه‌ رسید، با سرانگشتم لیست نام‌ها را دنبال کردم تا به نام او رسیدم. همیشه بر این باور بودم که اگر از ما دو تن یکی جان به در ‌برد، ‌باید او باشد. او می‌توانست مایه‌ی همبستگی مردم‌ باشد. پراکندگان را گرد هم آورد و گُسَستگان را به هم بپیوندد. در درازای زندگی‌اش همه‌ی اندیشه‌هایش، واژگانش به یک سرچشمه باز می‌گشتند و آن سرنوشت مشترک ملی بود. سخنانش پرواز می کردند. اتحاد چنان گریزان است که وقتی برای یک خط یا یک حزب یا یک سیاست مبارزه کنی، آنچه می‌بینی تنها کشمکش است. تنها یک چیز است که ما در آن مشترک هستیم و آن ایران است. و ایران است که ما برایش مبارزه می‌کنیم. بر آنم کسی بیش از او درباره‌ی ایران نمی‌دانست و ایران را دوست نداشت. چندی بعد شنیدیم که واپسین سخنش چنین بوده است: “به من نیندیشید، به ایران بیندیشید.” دکتر عاملی اندیشمندی یگانه بود. می‌توانست از پس هر کاری برآید. فرهمند بود. آزمندی از جانش دور بود، گنجینه‌ی جانش آکنده از مهر ایران بود. آگاهانه برگزیده بود کمتر داشته باشد تا بیشتر  کار کند، برای ایران. چنین کسانی کمیابند، بلکه نایاب. باید تندیسی از او در دل ایرانشهر ساخت. کس داستان زندگی‌اش را نشنید. کس داستان مرگ‌اش را نشنید. گویی دانه‌ای بود که در خاک نیفتاده است. مراسم یادبودی هم بر پا نشد. نتوانستیم به یاد او گرد هم‌آییم و غمگُساری کنیم. درد مرا رها نمی‌کرد. تنها راه دوام آوردن، ادامه‌ی کار بود. پایداری تا توان داریم. تالاری که هیچکس نتواند صدایمان را بشنود، پیدا کردیم. و شب‌ها دیرهنگام گرد هم می‌آمدیم. می‌آمدند تا با نوای خوش برای ایران آواز و ترانه ‌بخوانند، سرودهای ملی، مردمی و میهنی. سرودهای دلدادگی به ایران. نوارهای کاست سخنرانی‌های دکتر عاملی را میان مردم پخش می‌کردیم. کمترین کاری که می‌توانستیم انجام دهیم، پخش کردن اندیشه‌هایش بود. بر روی جلد نوار کاست، چهره‌‌ی تابناکش کنار درفش شیر و خورشید نشان بود؛ دو‌ نماد امیدبخش از روزگاران کهن‌: خورشید، سرچشمه‌ی نور و روشنایی و شیر، دلیرترین جاندار ایرانزمین. شیرخانواده دوست، شیر گریزناپذیر، نمادی از جان و دل، دلیری و نیرو",

  "text": "(41/54) “Mitra couldn’t sleep without me. On the nights when I came home late, I’d always find her awake listening to tapes. We still read poetry together. Even in the midst of the chaos, even on the darkest nights, even if only for twenty minutes. It was my greatest comfort. The time when I felt most at peace. One of the most famous love stories in all of Shahnameh is the tale of Bijan and Manijeh. It’s a special story. Because it’s the one time in Shahnameh when Ferdowsi reveals a glimpse of his own life. He writes in the chapter’s opening that he has fallen into a great depression. He describes a night so dark that no birds sing. He calls for his wife to join him, and she brings him a candle. She offers to tell him a story, and Ferdowsi agrees to weave it into verse. She tells him the story of Bijan and Manijeh. Bijan is a champion of Iran. Manijeh is the daughter of an enemy king. By chance they meet in the forest, and Manijeh mistakes Bijan for an angel. She falls in love at first sight. She smuggles him back to her palace, and they spend several nights in each other’s arms. Until their love is discovered by the king. He grows so angry that he cries tears of blood. He banishes Manijeh from the palace. And he sentences Bijan to a fate worse than death. Total darkness. Bijan is chained to the bottom of the deepest pit, and a stone is rolled over the entrance. But Manijeh will not allow him to die. She roams the countryside, begging for food. She digs a hole beneath the stone, just large enough to fit her hand. And she keeps Bijan alive. One handful at a time.”\n\nمیترا بی من خوابش نمی‌برد. شبها که دیر به خانه بر‌می‌گشتم، میترا را چشم به راه، گوش به آهنگ‌ها و ترانه‌ها می‌دیدم. هنوز برای یکدیگر شعر می‌خواندیم. در میان آشوب، در تاریکی شب. اگر هم کوتاه، دمی پایدار و دلپذیر در زندگی‌ما بود. یکی از پرآوازه‌ترین داستان‌های عاشقانه‌ی شاهنامه، داستان بیژن و منیژه است. فردوسی تنها یکبار در شاهنامه گوشه‌ای از زندگی‌اش را می‌نمایاند. در آغاز داستان، فردوسی سخن از افسردگی خود می‌گوید: شبی چون شبه روی شُسته به قیر  /  نه بهرام پیدا، نه کیوان، نه تیر  /  نه آوای مرغ و نه هرای دد  /  زمانه زبان بسته از نیک و بد  /  بدان تنگی اندر، بجَستم ز جای  /  یکی مهربان بودم اندر سرای  /  مِی آورد و نار و تُرنج و بِهی  /  زُدوده یکی جام شاهنشهی  /  دلم بر همه کار پیروز کرد / شب تیره همچون گه روز کرد. در چنین شبی همسرش برایش داستانی می‌گوید تا آنرا با زبان شیوایش بسراید. مرا گفت برخیز و دل شاد دار  /  روان را ز درد و غم آزاد دار  /  نگر تا که دل را نداری تباه  /  ز اندیشه و داد فریاد خواه  /  جهان، چون گذاری، همی بگذرد  /  خردمند مردم چرا غم خورد؟ همسرش داستان بیژن و منیژه را برایش بازمی‌گوید. بیژن سردار جوان ایرانی از دوده‌ی پهلوانان بزرگ ایران و منیژه دخت افراسیاب، تورانشاه: شود کوه آهن چو دریای آب / اگر بشنود نام افراسیاب. یکدیگر را در جنگل اَرمان می‌بینند. بیژن به فرمان کِی‌خسرو به کشتن گرازان آمده است .منیژه بیژن را پریزاده‌ای به زیبایی سیاوش می‌پندارد، بیژن می‌گوید: سیاوش نی‌اَم، نَز پریزادگان / از ایرانم، از شهر آزادگان. منیژه به او دل می‌بازد و او را پنهانی به کاخ خود می‌برد و شبی چند را با شور و شادی می‌گذرانند. افراسیاب آگاه می‌شود، بیژن را در چاه و منیژه را در کوی و برزن رها می‌کند. منیژه، شاهدخت زیبای بی‌پروا، روزها لب نانی می‌جوید تا خود و بیژن زنده بمانند. او سوراخی زیر سنگ ‌کَنده بود، به اندازه‌ی یک مُشت",

Then there’d be a round of single shots, to make sure the prisoners were dead. I’d lay in bed and count them. When the newspaper arrived later that morning, I’d search for his name among the killed. I was so angry with him. He’d been so careless. On the day he decided to leave the safehouse, he had even made a joke. He’d said: ‘If they arrest me, we’ll all go to court and have a good laugh.’ He knew that he’d done nothing wrong. His entire career, he had been the model of integrity. He thought that his innocence would be enough. He thought: ‘What is true, will be true for everyone.’ But in this system there was no 𝘳𝘢𝘴𝘵𝘪. There was no 𝘥𝘢𝘢𝘥. It was one set of rules for believers, and another set of rules for nonbelievers. I watched some of the show trials on television, to see if I could find him. There were no lawyers, no witnesses, nothing. Just a few people with beards. They’d hand down vague sentences like ‘Crimes against God,’ which carried a sentence of death. We tried everything. We looked everywhere, we called everyone, but nobody knew where they’d taken him. Finally we were able to arrange a meeting with one of Iran’s highest ranking religious figures, Ayatollah Shariatmadari.  We visited him at his house and pleaded with him to intercede. We told him: an innocent man has been arrested, one of the most honest men in all of Iran. There must be some justice. There must be some consideration of the truth. The Ayatollah was a good man. A man with 𝘯𝘦𝘦𝘬𝘪. He was a man of faith, rather than a religious man. He listened with concern; we could see the compassion in his eyes. But there was nothing he could do. He’d already fallen out of favor with Khomeini; and a few months later he’d be arrested himself. After that there was no hope.” \n\nهر بامداد با صدای شلیک تیرباران‌ها بیدار می‌شدیم. اعدام‌ها در ابتدا با شلیک مسلسل‌ها آغاز می‌شد. سپس یک دور شلیک‌های تک‌تیر تا یقین یابند که همه را کشته‌اند. من دراز کشیده بر تخت شلیک‌ها را می‌شمردم.  زمانی که روزنامه‌ی صبحگاهی به دستم می‌رسید، دنبال نامش می‌گشتم. دلم گرفته بود. بی‌احتیاطی کرده، از پناهگاهش رفته بود، شوخی هم کرده، گفته بود: “اگر مرا دستگیر کنند، در دادگاه کمی می‌خندیم.” می‌دانست که کار خلافی نکرده است. تمام زندگی‌اش را نمونه‌ی راستی و صداقت بود. فسادناپذیر بود. در این گمان که بی‌گناهی‌اش کافی‌ست، می‌پنداشت که فرصتی برای بیان راستی‌ها خواهد داشت. باور داشت: «حقیقت آنست که برای همگان پذیرفتنی باشد.» ولی در  این نظام، نه راستی بود و نه داد. برای کافران و مؤمنان دو نوع عدالت وجود داشت. در جستجوی او دادگاه‌های نمایشی را تماشا می‌کردم. نه وکیلی، نه شاهدی. احکام ریشوها  \"محاربه با خدا\" و \"فساد در زمین\" بود. تازه اگر دادگاهی هم تشکیل می‌شد. ما همه‌ی راهها را آزمودیم. همه جا را برای پیدا کردن او جستجو کردیم. هیچکس چیزی نمی‌دانست. محسن پزشکپور دیداری با یکی از پرنفوذترین روحانیون ایران ترتیب داد. برای ملاقات آقای شریعتمداری به قم رفتیم. از او خواستیم که برای حفظ جان دکتر عاملی کاری کند. مرد خوبی بود. مرد نیکخویی. بیش از آنکه مذهبی باشد، مرد ایمان می‌نمود. با نگرانی سخنان ما را شنید. همدردی داشت. گفت سفارش می‌کند. کاری از دستش برنیامد. خمینی کینه‌توز او را برنمی‌تابید. دیری نپایید که او را هم بازداشت و با او بدرفتاری کردند. دیگر هیچ روزنه‌ی امیدی نمانده بود",

  "text": "(39/54) “It would have been suicide to fight. There were no courts to petition. No laws to challenge. The only weapon that we had left were our words. I joined together with five colleagues from the Pan-Iranist party, and we formed an underground journal. We met daily in an abandoned office. We wrote with pen and paper, and when each issue was finished it would be secretly printed by a friend that worked at a publishing house. I wrote under the name of Rahdmard. It was the same name Mitra and I would later give to our fourth child, who was born severely disabled. It means a man who is noble. A man who is morally upright. It’s what I wanted for him, and it’s what I wanted for myself as well. In my articles I never attacked the regime directly. I didn’t mention the executions. I never named any names. Instead I wrote about ideals and principles. 𝘋𝘢𝘢𝘥. 𝘙𝘢𝘴𝘵𝘪. 𝘈𝘻𝘢𝘥𝘪i. I said: ‘Let us not lose ourselves. Let us not descend back into darkness.’ We had no idea if our words were being read. Each issue would only be one thousand copies, and we’d only pass them out amongst our friends. But we were like a dying person who was desperate to live. If we wanted to survive, these were the breaths we had to take. Just being together gave us hope. Darkness was pressing in all around us. But coming together for a single purpose, a single goal—it gave our hearts energy. Each day we’d share the news we’d seen and heard. We talked about what we could do, how we could help. One of the members had been sheltering Dr. Ameli at his house. He’d been staying there since the first days of the revolution. But after several weeks he began to miss his wife and family. So he decided to leave the safehouse. He knew that he was innocent, so he took a chance. He went back home. And that’s where they grabbed him.” \n\n(۳۹) پیکار با آنها خودکشی بود. امید چندانی برای نبرد مسلحانه نبود. دادگاهی برای دادخواست وجود نداشت. قانونی برای به چالش کشیدن نداشتیم. تنها کارمان نوشتن بود. همراه پنج تن از یاران ‌پان‌ایرانیست مجله‌ای زیرزمینی راه‌ انداختیم. با کاغذ و خودکار می‌نوشتیم. مجله پنهانی به دست دوستی که در چاپخانه کار می‌کرد آماده می‌شد. از هر شماره تنها هزار نسخه. آن را  میان دوستان پخش می‌کردیم. من با نام رادمرد می نوشتم. مرد آزاده و جوانمرد. راست‌کردار . مردی که آرزو داشتم باشم. این نام را برای چهارمین فرزندمان برگزیدیم. او بیمار زاده شد. آن ویژگی‌ها را برایش می‌خواستم. در نوشته‌هایم به رژیم نتاختم. از اعدام‌ها سخن نگفتم. نامی از کسی نبود. درباره‌ی آرمان‌ها و بنیادها نوشتم. داد، راستی، آزادی. می‌خواستم خود را فراموش نَکُنیم، به تاریکی فرو نیفتیم. نمی‌دانستیم که نوشته‌هامان خوانده می‌شوند یا نه. تلاش‌هایی نومیدانه برای زنده ماندن بود. هر روز خبرهایی را که دیده و شنیده بودیم با هم در میان می‌گذاشتیم. درباره‌ی آنچه می‌توانستیم انجام دهیم و کمک‌هایی که از دستمان برمی‌آمد، گفت‌وگو می‌کردیم. ما پشتیبان هم بودیم و برای آرمانی همگانی و هدفی مشترک همگام، و این به ما دلگرمی می‌داد. روزگاری بیم‌آمیز بود و همین با هم بودن امید می‌بخشید. نواری از آژیر با نیمرخی از چهر مهربانش بر آن که درفش شیر و خورشید نشان بر گردنش جنبان بود، جاکلیدی و سنجاق‌سینه‌هایی با نشان شیر و خورشید، جزوه‌ی «کار، تنها سند مالکیت و یگانه پاسدار آن» از کارهای آن روزهاست. یکی از دوستان از نخستین روزهای پس از شورش پناهگاهی برای دکتر عاملی فراهم کرده بود. دلتنگی همسر، فرزندان و دیگر گرامیانش او را از پناهگاه بیرون کشاند. او را در خانه‌ی پدری دستگیر کردند.",

  "text": "(2/2) \"I'm from Sweden and Nature is something I've always loved and taken for granted. Growing up we spent most of our time in the woods. They were our playground where we learned to build shelters, foraged for fruit and slept under the stars. That's where we felt most alive, present and free, and I desperately want my children, and my children's children, to be able to have that Nature connection too. At Parents for Future UK we're asking people to actually change their personal behaviours. That will help the government to make the right decisions because there will be an economic mandate to do so.  We can't create all the change we need just by civil disobedience. I've worked in advertising for years and seen ideas like the importance of representing ethnic diversity spread until they become normal. Now so many ad campaigns are about respecting ecosystems and loving Nature. We just have to make sure they're not just 'greenwashing' their brands. That's why I want to carry on with my advertising photography, inspiring people through ethically honest and true projects as well as working through a grassroots movement. \n\n\"Knowing so much about the climate emergency does fill me with dread, but I deal with that feeling by turning it into action. I can't not do anything. That's what I and other volunteers for Parents for Future, and other movements like Extinction Rebellion, Climate Action Network-International and Global Call for Climate Action, have all had to come to terms with, and that's why we're all working so frenetically. The really scary thing is seeing how many others are not acknowledging the threat. Some might feel they're too busy, others that they're too depressed, or powerless, or that they don't know what they can do to make a difference. But everyone has to find a way to take an active role in trying to create the necessary change. Because governments aren't taking any serious steps to protect our planet for future generations, and they're not going to unless they are pressured by normal people like us. That's the best way to show how much we care for our children.\"\n\nSandra, photographed by Trisha in St James's Park, and phone-HoGLed recently.",

  "text": "(1/2) \"This is me with my daughters at the 'Beehive, Baby!' march organised by Extinction Rebellion Families in May 2019. At the time Alba was 13, Agnes was 8 and Iris was 3. Their dad Chris was with us, he's been part of all the actions we've done, but like me he's a photographer and he was off photographing the march. Reading the 2018 IPCC report, where scientists agreed we had just 12 years to cut our carbon emissions by 50% to limit temperature rise to 1.5 degrees or face catastrophic climate breakdowns, made me realise we all have to fight for the right of our kids to a healthy planet. During the first Youth Strike for Climate in February 2019, I'd shared a moment of hope with other mums there. We were all so impressed by the dedication of the young people taking to the streets across the world, but we also shared a moment of shame. Why should these issues be laid on young people already burdened with the pressures of growing up? It felt really important to show my kids that their mum was shouldering the responsibility and not just leaving it to them. \n\n\"Parents across the world had already started organising to support the young people as Parents for Future Global so we set up our own Parents for Future UK. Now we have weekly online meetings with parents across the UK, and in places like Brazil, Nigeria, India and Australia too, where we come together and discuss ways of making change. We're also working on going completely sustainable as a family, taking it one step at a time. It's become so much easier than people think. We started by going plastic-free for Christmas in 2019 which was fun. Then we started making sure all our toiletries and house cleaning products were ecofriendly too. You can shop at somewhere like Planet Organic or Whole Foods Market, use refillable metal bottles and shampoo bars, get grains in a paper bag and store them in a glass jar, and you don't ever have to see plastic in your house again. It helps my kids feel protected and safe. They really do think we're going to sort this out, or at least they can see we're really trying.\"\n\nSandra, photographed by Trisha with Agnes, Alba and Iris in St James's Park, and phone-HoGLed recently (1/2)",

The Iran that I had loved since I was a little boy—it was no use to them. They didn’t care about our culture, our history, our ideals. One day Khomeini gave a speech saying that nationalism was against Islam. He said that we should be a nation of Muslims, not a nation of Iranians. The Lion and the Sun were removed from our flag, two of the oldest symbols of Iran. They were replaced by Arabic writing. Our institutions were dismantled one-by-one, until the only things left of the republic and constitution were their names. They became empty boxes that no one knew what was inside. Three months after the revolution I took one final trip to Nahavand. These were the people who trusted me most. Nobody could say that I’d ever wronged them. I wanted to speak with them freely, and share my thoughts. I wanted to see if they grieved along with me. Normally the moment that my car pulled into town, the news would spread like wildfire. People would gather at the house of my father. It had a very large salon, and people would come and go as they pleased. They’d come in excited, passionate, sometimes angry. They’d be critical. They’d debate me. Everyone had something to say. But this time only a small crowd gathered. And I was the only one who spoke. I shared all of my concerns: that we were losing our ideals. We were losing 𝘋𝘢𝘢𝘥. We were losing 𝘕𝘦𝘦𝘬𝘪. We were losing 𝘙𝘢𝘴𝘵𝘪. We were losing 𝘈𝘻𝘢𝘥𝘪. But everyone just listened in silence. They knew my words were true. They knew better than me. But it was fear. They were silenced by fear. There is a famous parable about a caravan of one hundred merchants crossing the desert. Their camels are loaded down with riches. In the night they are overtaken by two bandits, and robbed of everything. Afterwards they are asked: ‘How could it possibly happen? There were one hundred of you, but only two of them.’ They replied: ‘Yes. But those two were together. And we were alone.”\n\nآن را نمی‌یافتم. ایران شاهنامه. ایران کوروش بزرگ. ایران خیام، مولانا، سعدی و حافظ. ایران مادران و ‌پدران‌مان. ایرانی که از کودکی دلبسته‌اش بودم. ارزشی برایشان نداشت. برای آنها فرهنگ، تاریخ  و آرمان‌ها بی‌ارج بودند. خمینی گفت ملی‌گرایی بر خلاف اسلام است. گفت ما باید امت مسلمان باشیم، نه ملت ایران. نشان شیر و خورشید، دو نماد هزاران ساله‌ی فرهنگ ایرانیان را از درفش ایرانزمین برداشتند، جایگزینش واژه‌ای عربی بود. سازمان‌ها و نهادها را فرو پاشاندند. به زودی دریافتیم که جمهوریت و قانون اساسی‌شان نامی بیش نبود، قالبی میان تهی. سه ماه پس از شورش، سفر‌ی به نهاوند داشتم. آنجا زادگاه گرامی من بود‌، مردمانش، ارجمندانی که دلبسته‌ی هم بودیم. در زمانی کوتاه کارهایی برایشان کرده بودم. خواهان دانستن برخورد و برداشتشان بودم. آیا چون من افسرده و غمگین یا امیدوار، شاد و خشنودند. گفت‌وگو با آنان بایسته می‌نمود. پیشتر دیدن خودرو من آژیروار همه را خبر می‌کرد. در تالار خانه گرد می‌آمدیم . مردمی پرشور، هیجانزده، شاد، غمزده، آرام یا خشمگین می‌آمدند و می‌رفتند. بحث و انتقاد و درخواست‌های شخصی و شهری از هرگونه پیش می‌آمد. رایزنی‌ها برای همه آموزنده و دلنشین بود، امید در هوا موج می‌زد. ولی این بار تنها شماری اندک آمدند و تنها من بودم که سخن می‌گفتم. تمام نگرانی‌هایم را با آنها در میان گذاشتم. اینکه آزادی‌هایی را هم که داشتیم از دستمان می‌گیرند. راستی کاسته و کژی افزوده می‌شود. بیداد، بیداد می‌کند. دیدم همه خاموشند. دریافتم که همه همآواییم. آنچه زبانشان را بُریده، ترس است. از ترس دم درکشیده بودند. همه رفتند، جز یکی، دوستی که اسب و تفنگی هم داشت. گفت: “در شهر ناکسان در کارند، نا‌امن است .شب را به خانه‌ی ما بیا، تنها نمان.” نگران من بود. چندان پافشاری کرد تا پذیرفتم. ایران سرزمین آزادگان و جوانمردان است! زبانزد پرآوازه‌ای هست درباره‌ی کاروانی از سد بازرگان که از بیابان می‌گذشتند. بر شترهاشان بارهای گرانبها می‌بردند. شباهنگام دو دزد بر آنان شبیخون ‌زدند و همه‌ی دارایی‌‌شان را دزدیدند. در آبادی از آنها ‌پرسیدند: \"چگونه پیش آمد؟ شما سد تن بودید و دزدان تنها دو تن.\" پاسخ دادند: \"زیرا آن دو تن با هم و ما سد تن تنها بودیم!”",

But everything beautiful had been removed: the paintings, the carpets, the furniture. In the center of the room was a single table, and at its head sat one of the leaders of the Revolutionary Council. It was the body ultimately responsible for deciding the fate of the regime’s enemies. My colleague groveled. He read a prepared statement. He thanked the man for his wisdom. He thanked him for allowing us to keep our salaries. Then when he finished his remarks, he motioned to me and said: ‘My colleague would like to say something.’ I was caught by surprise. I had nothing prepared. I could have just thanked the man. But when an injustice has been committed, I must speak. Its part of my code. It’s something I hold as dear as my own spirit. Because if we don’t live our ideals—then they don’t exist. 𝘋𝘢𝘢𝘥. 𝘕𝘦𝘦𝘬𝘪. 𝘙𝘢𝘴𝘵𝘪. Justice, Goodness, Truth. They depend on us. We are the ones who must make them real. They only exist when we are living them. Truth is not some abstract concept. Truth is something you say. Truth is something you do. No matter how great the fear, you must follow your code. You must stay true to your ideals. Because if you do not, that fear will stay with you. It will break you. Every day it will remind you: you weren’t who you thought you were. And I’m not ready to lose the rest of my life to a single moment. There was a burnt match lying on the floor next to my foot. I picked it up off the ground. I looked the man in the eye, and I told him: ‘Maybe you should be thanking us, for not allowing this injustice.’ Then I held the burnt match in front of my face. ‘Even if you’d asked,’ I told him. ‘I wouldn’t have given you this burnt match.’” \n\nجلسه در دفتر رئیس سابق مجلس برگزار شد. او چهار هفته پیش اعدام شده بود. آنچه را نشانی از زیبایی داشت، برداشته بودند: نقاشی‌ها، فرش‌ها، میز، صندلی، همه چیز. محمدرضا مهدوی کنی، رئیس کمیته‌ی انقلاب اسلامی و عضو شورای انقلاب پشت میزی کهنه و رنگ و رو رفته نشسته بود. ما هم روی دو نیمکت در دو سوی میز کوتاه و درازی جای گرفتیم. همکارم یادداشتش را خواند. او را ستود، چاپلوسی و سپاسگزاری کرد که به ما اجازه داده بودند دریافتی‌هایمان را پس ندهیم. دلم گرفت، آزرده شدم. هنگامی که سخنانش تمام شد، به سوی من برگشت و گفت: “همکارم دوست دارد چیزی بگوید.” من نخواسته بودم. من چیزی آماده نکرده بودم. می‌توانستم سپاسی بگویم. اما درونم می‌جوشید. باید چیزی گفت. پاره‌ای از قانون زندگی‌ست. پاره‌ای از آرمان است. آنها به ما وابسته‌اند: داد، نیکی، راستی، آزادی. کار بزرگ ما چهره بخشیدن به آنهاست. آرمان‌ها تنها زمانی هستند که آنها را زندگی کنیم. باید به آرمان‌هامان پایبند بمانیم، هر اندازه وسوسه‌ها بزرگ باشند، هر اندازه بیم‌انگیز باشند. اگر از آرمان‌ها‌ در برابر ترس بگذریم، آرمان‌ها می‌میرند اما ترس با ما خواهد ماند. با ما خواهد زیست و ما را خواهد شکست. خواهیم دانست آن چه می‌اندیشیدیم، نیستیم. نمی‌پذیرم که بازمانده‌ی عمرم را در یک لحظه ببازم. یکراست به چشمان رئیس کمیته‌ی انقلاب نگاه کردم. گفتم: “هر بیدادی دو سو دارد. یکی ستمگر است و دیگری ستمدیده. شما نیز باید سپاسگزار ما باشید که در برابر این بیداد ایستادیم.” کبریت سوخته‌ای را که جلوی پایم بر زمین افتاده بود، برداشتم، نشانش دادم و گفتم: “اگر این کبریت سوخته را هم از من می‌خواستید، به شما نمی‌دادم.”",

They did what no invader had been able to do for three thousand years—erase our nation, our culture, our connection to the past. But they did it from the inside. In the beginning things were relaxed. The first Prime Minister was a pious Muslim, but he was an educated man. A thoughtful man. Mitra attended an event where he was speaking, and his wife wasn’t even wearing a hijab. But the clerics slowly worked their way into government. And the more they got power, the more the environment became closed. Cinemas were shut down. Music was banned from television. The poetry of Farrokhzad was banned. It’s not that Mitra promoted Khomeini, but she defended him. She’d say that the king wasn’t innocent either. She said that she liked the hijab. She felt that it was a symbol of modesty, and respect for tradition. At the time I was more religious than Mitra. But I couldn’t make her understand: the problem isn’t Islam. There is nothing wrong with hijab. But there must be 𝘢𝘻𝘢𝘥𝘪. There must be the freedom to choose. I think Mitra only took the other side because she wanted to discourage me from speaking out. She wanted to keep me safe. Dr. Ameli had already gone into hiding. The regime was looking for any reason to go after people. They’d sent agents to Nahavand looking for evidence of corruption, but they could not find a thing. One day Khomeini ordered every member of parliament to pay back their salaries. But my former colleagues in the opposition petitioned for an exemption. They argued that we’d been critical of the king’s policies, and at the last minute an exemption was granted. One of my colleagues requested a meeting with a leader of the Revolutionary Council. He wanted to express his gratitude, and he asked me to come along for support. I didn’t want to do it. I didn’t feel any gratitude at all. I hadn’t done anything wrong. It would have been unjust to take my salary. But he begged me to come. And he promised that I would not need to speak.” \n\nمتعصبان مذهبی کمتر از ده درصد بودند. اما اسلحه‌ در دست آنها بود. شبیه خودمان بودند. با زبان ما سخن می‌گفتند. کاری کردند که هیچ اشغالگری در طول سه‌هزار سال نکرده بود - نابودی ملت ما، فرهنگ ما و پیوند با گذشته‌مان. آنها این کار را از درون انجام دادند. در آغاز همه چیز آرام بود. نخستین نخست‌وزیر مسلمانی مؤمن بود. تحصیل‌کرده بود. مردی اندیشمند بود. میترا در مراسمی با نخست‌وزیر جدید و همسرش شرکت کرد. در آن مراسم خانم نخست‌وزیر حجاب نپوشیده بود. اما روحانیون آرام آرام وارد ساختار دولت شدند. نخست معاون، سپس وزیر شدند. با افزایش قدرت روحانیون فضای سیاسی بسته‌تر ‌شد. سینماها را بستند. پخش موسیقی از تلویزیون ممنوع شد. شعرهای فروغ فرخزاد ممنوع شد. میترا هرگز برای خمینی تبلیغ نکرد. اما از او دفاع می‌کرد. می‌گفت که شاه بی‌گناه نبوده است. می‌گفت دوست دارد حجاب بپوشد. فکر می‌کرد که نمادی از فروتنی و احترام به سنت است. آن زمان من آداب مسلمانی را بیش از او پیروی می‌کردم. می‌خواستم بداند که اسلام مشکلی ندارد. حجاب مشکلی ندارد. مهم حق گزینش است. بایستی آزادی باشد. بایستی آزادی گزینش باشد. جانبداری او از آنان تنها از ترس جان من بود. او می‌خواست که مخالفت نکنم و خاموش بمانم.  دکتر عاملی پنهان شده بود. دادگاه‌های انقلاب دنبال هر بهانه‌ای می‌گشتند تا مردم را بازداشت کنند. آنها نمایندگانی را به نهاوند فرستاده بودند تا شاید نشانی از فساد بیابند. آنها چیزی نیافتند. روزی خمینی دستور داد که همه‌ی نمایندگان مجلس باید دریافتی‌های خود را برگردانند. من تنها پانزده تومان در حساب بانکی‌ام داشتم. نمی‌دانستم چه باید کرد. همکاران من در گروه اقلیت مجلس گرد آمدند. نامه‌هایی نوشتند و استدلال آوردند که آنها همیشه از کارهای شاه انتقاد کرده‌اند. در پایان گفته شد که نمایندگان اقلیت دریافتی‌هایشان را نگه دارند. یکی از همکاران درخواست جلسه‌ای با رئیس کمیته‌ی انقلاب اسلامی کرده بود. می‌خواست از او سپاسگزاری کند. من کار نادرستی نکرده بودم. گرفتن دریافتی من ناعادلانه بود. از من خواست که با او همراه شوم. دلخواه من نبود، پافشاری کرد، گفتم من آنجا سخنی نخواهم گفت، پذیرفت",

  "text": "\"Both my parents are teachers, believe in hard work and are very musical. So I learnt violin, recorder and piano, joined the local choir, got distinctions in my music grades and A stars in my exams, and was one of the few from my comprehensive who got into Cambridge University, where I did a music degree. Growing up in a really small village in Lincolnshire, I was always asking 'Why are things done this way?' So I thought Cambridge would be my time, that I'd meet all these bright, sparky people like me, full of entrepreneurial ideas and into deep conversations about ideas and possibilities. But most were very academic, more focussed on facts than the world, and with much more privileged backgrounds than me. I got my 2:1, but I couldn't afford to work 6 months upaid to get on the first rung of the classical music ladder, so I went into educational publishing instead. But I still didn't feel confident, or successful. \n\n\"Then HarperCollins sent me on a course about core values, and I realised what I care most about is music and connecting new audiences to it, so in 2018 I went freelance and set up Alternative Classical. So many young people think classical music is this rarefied thing you have to know lots about and listen to quietly in a concert hall, wearing black, or that it's all composed by white, middle-class old men in ivory towers. That's just not true - there's an incredible variety of much funkier venues, composers and music styles, and we're trying to dismantle those off-putting preconceptions so everyone can respond as emotionally to it as they would to any other art form. In February I also started Humans of Classical Music, where every Thursday someone young will say why they love a particular piece - it might be 'what I turn to when I really need to have a cry in the bath' - then we share a link to it. I love that I'm now bringing all my creative ideas to life, sharing my passions, bringing people together and inspiring positive change. At 32, after all those years of working really, really hard, I'm finally proud of what I'm achieving and so happy that I've found my tribe.\" \n\nHannah, photographed by Nick Rutter in Arnold Circus, Shoreditch.",

  "text": "\"Together, indigenous people protect 82% of the world's biodiversity. Why is life protected in indigenous territories? Because of how we think, how we relate to the world. We still sing and pray and salute and ask permission to the forest. We still work really, really hard to respect the Nature cycle, although of course many of us have lost our forests. Climate change is real. We need to protect what is left. We need to work together on reforestation, but we also cannot lose what we still have. That is why we are travelling the world to share our vision.\n\n\"Your economical, political and legal system of consumerism doesn't work for us. Your white, male, classist, racist, homophobic, mysogynist kind of thinking doesn't work for us. We want to change that paradigm. We have had enough of oppression - and we are ALL oppressed by that. It's not only the indigenous. The women, the men, the children, the elders. Nature is oppressed by that kind of thinking. Contemporary indigenous civilisations have so much to share - the science and wisdom of living in harmony with the cycles of Nature, as well as the ethics of respect for cultural diversity. We are 5,000 nations with almost 300 living languages, spread all over the world and of all colours, and we say 'We are all related.' And our family is not only humankind. We are also the sons and daughters of the rivers and the mountains and the forests. We are related to Nature. If we are really willing to change the paradigm, we can practice a little bit of silence and connect to other cultures through other languages, such as art and music. And we all need to know that the land is our Mother and we must protect her. She is in our veins.\"\n\nDaiara Tukano giving her 2019 talk 'Existence as Resistance: an Indigenous perspective from Brazil' to the Radical Anthropology Group in Taviton Street, WC1, supported by Extinction Rebellion.\n\nReposted in honour of today’s officially being #EarthDay.",

When the newspaper arrived later that morning, it would show the names and photographs of the dead. An atmosphere of fear began to spread across the country. It wasn’t just the killings. It was the news of the killings, the manner of the killings. They were random. They followed no law. Revolutionary tribunals were formed to deal with enemies of the regime, but there was no due process. Sometimes there wouldn’t even be a trial. Khomeini appointed an executioner as one of the judges. A bus would arrive at his court. He’d let one person pass, then hold the next. When the entire bus had been emptied—the people who were held back would be executed. The story spread across the country. When violence is random, when it is undeserved, when there is no 𝘥𝘢𝘢𝘥, everyone begins to think: I could be next. And that’s exactly what the regime wanted. People grew silent. They would only speak their mind inside their homes. One month after the revolution, there was the first protest against the regime. It happened on International Women’s Day. Thousands of women took to the streets to protest the mandatory hijab. They called for the freedom to choose. 𝘈𝘻𝘢𝘥𝘪. They screamed their slogans in the streets. But their words were never heard. The regime had already taken over the media, and the protests weren’t mentioned anywhere. Then came Khomeini’s followers. They fell on the women like savages, beating them with batons. Calling them ‘whores’ and ‘sluts.’ Bystanders looked on in fear. Nobody tried to defend them. No one spoke a word. There was silence.” \n\nاعدام‌ها سپیده‌دمان انجام می‌شد. هر بامداد با صدای تیرباران‌ها بیدار می‌شدیم. دیرتر، هنگامی که روزنامه‌ می‌رسید، عکس و نام کشته‌شدگان را می‌دیدیم. هاله‌‌ی ترس ایران را فرا گرفته بود. کشتن‌ تنها نبود. شیوه‌ی کشتن‌ها هم بود. آشفته بود. از هیچ قانونی پیروی نمی‌کرد. دادگاه‌های انقلابی برای برخورد با دشمنان رژیم برپا شده بودند. گاه دادگاهی هم برگزار نمی‌شد. یکی از دژخیمانی که خمینی برگزیده بود مسئول اصلی کشتارها بود. اگر اتوبوسی به دادسرای او می‌رسید، سرنشینانش را یکی در میان نگه می‌داشت. ‌پس از پیاده شدن همه‌ی سرنشینان، آنهایی را که نگه داشته بود، بی‌دادرسی اعدام می‌کرد. هنگامی که قانون نباشد، هنگامی که عدالت و دادگری نباشد، همه گمان می‌کنند، شاید نفر بعدی منم و رژیم درست همین را می‌خواست! مردم هراسیده بودند. خاموش شده بودند. یک ماه پس از انقلاب، اولین اعتراض خیابانی بر ضد رژیم رخ داد. در روز جهانی زن، هزاران زن به خیابان‌ها آمدند تا دربرابر حجاب اجباری اعتراض کنند. آنها خواهان آزادی انتخاب بودند. شعارهایشان را در خیابان‌ها فریاد می‌زدند. ولی صداهایشان شنیده نشد. تا آن زمان رژیم رسانه‌ها را در چنگ گرفته بود. هیچ جایی نامی از آنها برده نشد. سپس پلیس‌ و شهربانی - کسانی که باید از آنها دفاع می‌کردند با وحشیانه‌ترین و خشن‌ترین شکل ممکن به آنها حمله کردند، آنها را هرزه و فاحشه خواندند و با باتون زدند. هیچ کس در دفاع از آنها سخن نگفت. هیچکس سخنی نگفت. خاموشی بود.",

That morning a bullet came through our window and landed in the wall above our bed. The country became like a house in an earthquake. Everything was scattered and there was nowhere to hide. The streets were barricaded with big bags of sand. Behind them were men holding automatic weapons. The executions began on the roof of the same school building where we had met. First the generals were executed. A few days later it was the Prime Minister. Then several powerful members of parliament. Khomeini would walk out afterward to inspect the bodies. Our house was next to the prison where former members of the king’s government were being held. Every morning we’d wake to the sound of the firing squads. Gordafarid was ten years old at the time. She was scared by all the gunfire, so at night I’d read to her the story of her namesake: Gordafarid from Shahnameh. When the men refused to fight, Gordafarid tied her hair beneath her helmet. She loaded an arrow into her bow. And she rode out from the castle to face the enemy alone. She stopped just short of the enemy lines, and she roared. She roared like thunder! ‘Where are your champions? Who would dare to fight me?’ Only the enemy commander had the nerve to answer her challenge. With fury they fought. The battle burned, the rain of arrows, the spark of swords. Neither champion could strike a fatal blow. Then in the heat of the battle Gordafarid’s helmet was knocked to the ground. Her face shone like the moon. And her hair, her hair was worthy of a crown. The commander was stunned. A woman! It was a woman! He turned to his men, and screamed: ‘If the Iranians have women such as these, who would dare? Who would dare to face them?”\n\n۲۲ بهمن ارتش اعلام بی‌طرفی کرد. نیروهای خمینی جنگ‌افزارها را در اختیار گرفتند. بامداد آن روز گلوله‌ای از پنجره وارد اتاق‌مان شد و بر دیوار بالای تخت‌مان افتاد. کشور بسان خانه‌ای هنگام زمین‌لرزه‌ شد. همه چیز پراکنده و پخش شده بود و جایی برای پنهان شدن نبود. خیابان‌ها با کیسه‌های بزرگ شن سنگربندی شده بودند. پشت این سنگرها مردانی با اسلحه‌های خودکار ایستاده بودند. اعدام‌ها از پشت بام ساختمان مدرسه‌ای که با خمینی دیدار کرده بودیم، آغاز شد. ابتدا ژنرال‌ها اعدام شدند. پس از چند روز نوبت به وزیر امور خارجه رسید. سپس دو رئیس و چند نماینده‌ی مجلس. پس از هر دور اعدام، خمینی به پشت‌بام می‌رفت و جسد‌ها را بررسی می‌کرد. خانه‌ی ما کنار زندانی بود که دولتمردان رژیم شاه در آنجا زندانی بودند. هر بامداد با صدای تیراندازی بیدار می‌شدیم. در آن زمان گردآفرید ده‌ساله بود. او از صدای تیراندازی‌ها می‌ترسید، بنابراین شبها داستان گردآفرید را از شاهنامه برایش می‌خواندم. هنگامی که مردان از جنگیدن بازماندند، گردآفرید موهای بلندش را زیر کلاه‌خودش پنهان کرد و به تنهایی به رویارویی با دشمن به بیرون دژ سپید شتافت. در نزدیکی سپاه دشمن ایستاد. کمانش را در آورد. تیری از تیرکش بیرون کشید، و خروشید! بسان تندر خروشید: به پیش سپاه اندر آمد چو گَرد   /   چو رعد خروشان یکی ویله کرد   /   که گُردان کدامند و جنگ‌آوران   /   دلیران و کارآزموده سران. آنجاست که سهراب اسب خود را زین می‌کند و نبردی سهمگین میانشان درمی‌گیرد. نبردی سوزناک. بارانی از تیرها. درخشش شمشیرها. ولی هیچ‌کدام نمی‌توانند ضربه‌ی کُشنده‌ای وارد کنند. سپس در اوج نبرد کلاه‌خود گردآفرید بر زمین می‌افتد. چهره‌اش بسان خورشید می‌درخشد. و موهایش رها می‌شوند، موهایی سزاوار و درخور تاج. سهراب شگفت‌زده می‌شود. رو به سوی مردانش می‌کند: شگفت آمدش، گفت از ایران سپاه   /   چنین دختر آید به آوردگاه   /   سواران جنگی به روز نبرد   /   همانا به ابر اندر آرند گَرد",

But we still had a government, a parliament, a constitution. The only thing new was this man. Maybe he’d been telling the truth. Maybe he truly did want an open society. Khomeini had surrounded himself with liberal advisors. Maybe he’d allow them to run the country. Maybe he’d go to Qom and study his books. The parliament decided to form a small delegation to meet with him; to find out his plans. Since I’d been such a vocal member of the opposition, it was decided that I should go along. Khomeini had taken up residence in a school building directly behind the parliament. When we arrived we were escorted into an empty classroom. There was no furniture. Pillows and blankets were piled against the wall; it was clear that people had been sleeping there. After five minutes Khomeini entered the room. He was dressed all in black. After he took his seat we explained that we were hoping for a peaceful transition of power. One that kept the constitution intact, and the parliament in place. We presented a list of ministers that we thought he would approve. He listened in silence. At no point did he ask a question. At no point did he give a response. It was clear that he had no need for our participation. Power was in his hands. When we finished making our proposal, he asked us to deliver two messages. One: he wanted us to tell the military that they had his full support. And two: that no one would be harmed, except for the king. When asked later about his promises, he would claim that Islam allows lying in times of war.” \n\nروزی که هواپیمای خمینی فرود آمد، سدها هزار نفر از فرودگاه تا شهر به پیشواز او آمده بودند. شاه رفته بود. اما هنوز دولت، مجلس و قانون اساسی بر جای بودند. تنها مهره‌ی جدید، یک روحانی بود. شاید راست بگوید؟ شاید به راستی خواهان جامعه‌ای آزاد باشد؟ خمینی را مشاوران لیبرال احاطه کرده بودند. شاید اجازه دهد آنها کشور را اداره کنند؟ شاید به قم می‌رفت و سرگرم خواندن کتاب‌هایش می‌شد؟ گروه اقلیت مجلس تصمیم گرفت پنج نفر را برای ملاقات با او و آگاهی از برنامه‌هایش تشکیل دهد. من یکی از آن پنج تن بودم. خمینی در مدرسه‌ای پشت مجلس اقامت داشت. وقتی وارد شدیم، ما را به کلاسی خالی هدایت کردند. هیچگونه اسباب و اثاثی در اتاق نبود. روشن بود که از آن اتاق برای خواب استفاده می‌شد زیرا بالش‌ها و تشک‌هایی کنار دیوار انباشته شده بودند. پس از پنج دقیقه خمینی وارد اتاق شد. جایی نشست. به او گفتیم که ما امیدوار به جابه‌جایی صلح‌آمیز قدرت هستیم. انتقالی که قانون اساسی را حفظ کرده و مجلس را در جای خود نگه دارد. او در سکوت سخنان ما را شنید. هیچ پاسخی نداد. هیچ پرسشی نکرد، نیازی به مشارکت نداشت. تمام قدرت را یکجا می‌خواست. از ما خواست دو پیام را به بیرون برسانیم. نخست به سران ارتش بگوییم که خمینی خواهان بالا بردن احترام آنهاست و دوم آنکه هیچ کسی جز شاه مجازات نخواهد شد. دیری نپایید که دروغ گفتن را در هنگام جنگ روا دانست",

A few weeks later he asked me to be his boyfriend and I said 'Yes!' I knew he was special from the first day we started talking and I'd told my college friend Krithika about him. She's been a constant support ever since I came out 7 years ago, and she was so happy for me, saying 'Damn - he's so handsome!' I went with him to Rome so I could meet his parents and friends, who all welcomed me warmly into the family, and we survived a long-distance relationship for a while, visiting each other every 2 weeks. When he moved in with me last year, we were together 24/7 thanks to the lockdown and got to know each other's true selves so much better. \n\n\"He's such a kind and caring person, such an honest soul, and a real gentleman. We are quite different in some ways but we balance each other out well. He's 35 and I'm 25, yet we feel as if we're the same age - maybe because he has a younger soul and I have an older one? He's also very patient whereas I can be quite short-tempered. He tends to live in the moment, be more spontaneous and chilled, whereas I'm more organised and focused on the future, and I'm always doing something. We do have our heated arguments, particularly over who gets to have more dessert or chocolate as we're both serious foodies with a very sweet tooth! But we're quick to make up and apologise. I don’t think we've ever stopped talking for more than a day. He's Sri Lankan with Italian citizenship, and he cooks amazing food from both cuisines. He's much more stylish and fashionable than me, so he's really helped me improve my wardrobe. He also helps me relax when I'm feeling anxious, giving me that tight hug and warm cuddle which makes me forget about everything else and feel safe. He's made me see the world differently, and push myself to be better every day. He's definitely my rock and I am his. When life throws its curve balls we're there for each other. Now I can’t wait for us to form our Civil Partnership in a couple of weeks!\"\n\nJoyston, with Sugith (3/3)",

  "text": "(2/3) \"My parents were both brought up in the traditional Mangalorean religious way, as part of big families. After they married they moved to Qatar and I was brought up there. My dad has always been my role model. Hard-working and enduring, he shows his love in his own way, and has always said 'Nothing is impossible in life. You can do it if you wish to.' My mom is warmer, more emotional and openly caring, but also strong. She's an exceptional cook and I'd been longing to taste her food again, but to keep brokering peace between my parents and Sugith wasn't easy, and hearing them talk to family back in India and Sugith not even being mentioned just felt soul-crushing and unacceptable. So on the 25th of March 2021 I did the scariest, most heart-wrenching and agonisingly thought-through thing I've ever done. I posted my coming-out story on Facebook.\n\n\"After years of feeling suffocated, breathless, I felt I had to take a stand. Sugith is always saying 'you should take control of your life and not let others dictate your happiness'. But my heart was in my mouth, and initially angry words were exchanged before silence fell in the house. Then the post started filling up with all these supportive comments from cousins, friends, uncles and aunties, friends of the family. It was deeply touching and empowering to feel so much love. That's when I realised - it wasn't just me who needed love and acceptance. My parents did too. They've loved me all my life and were probably feeling just as suffocated by having to hide the truth, fearing they'd be rejected and shamed by Indian society. Education, love and acceptance - that's the key. Now they seem to have finally let go of their worry about what others might say, and are even standing up for me against those who disapprove. They can see how much Sugith cares for me, and just want us both to be happy as a couple. So to anyone else in a similar situation, I'd say: Love yourself. Yes, it can take a great deal of courage to be who you truly are, but don't give up. Fight for your happiness and your truth. Join hands and seek support. Find your wings.\" \n\nJoyston, photographed in Pitville Park and January's snow (2/3)",

  "text": "(32/54) “In the end the king turned against his own friends. One day a colleague approached me in the halls of parliament. She was married to a former minister, and the king had just thrown her husband in jail to appease the mobs. She asked me what I thought was going to happen. I answered with a quote from Shahnameh: ‘Tomorrow I will calm your fear.’ Even then I still had hope. I thought we still had time to save the country. But those were the end days. On the Friday after Ramadan there was a huge protest in one of Tehran’s main squares. The army panicked and fired machine guns into the crowd. One hundred people were killed, and that night one hundred fires raged in Tehran.  Strikes began to hit the country. Everything shut down: schools, factories, air travel, even the oil industry. The lifeblood of Iran. The country became like a paralyzed man, gasping for its final breaths. In October the king went on television. It would be his final speech to the Iranian people. By then he was suffering-from late-stage cancer. He was a very sick man. He apologized for past mistakes. He said: ‘I am the guardian of a constitutional monarchy, which is a God-given gift. A gift entrusted to the Shah by the people.’ He said that he had finally heard our voice, but it was too late. The people had stopped listening. The king only had one option left.. His generals were still loyal. He still controlled the military, and there were half a million men under arms. He could fight. He could hold onto power, but only if he spilled the blood of Iranians. He had a choice. There’s always a choice to be made. Three months later I was listening to Mohsen Pezeshkpour give a speech from the podium of parliament; he was the founder of the Pan-Iranist party. In the middle of his speech, a messenger handed a note across the podium. He read the note, then over the microphone we heard him ask loudly: ‘Where did he go?’ The crowd let out a gasp. We knew then, the king was gone. The flag had fallen. The day was lost. And there’d be no more role for us to play. That’s the problem with absolute power. It’s like a tent with a single pillar. And when you take out that pillar—everything collapses.”\n\n(۳۲) در پایان شاه به دوستانش پشت کرد. روزی در تالار مجلس همکاری نزد من آمد. دلواپس و هراسان بود. همسرش از وزیران پیشین بود. شاه به تازگی برای دلجویی از شورشیان او را زندانی کرده بود. پرسید: چه خواهد شد؟ با شاهنامه پاسخش را دادم: «من امروز ترسِ تو را بشکنم». حتا در آن زمان هنوز امیدوار بودم‌. می‌پنداشتم هنوز زمان برای نجات کشور باقی‌ست. ولی آن روزها، روزهای واپسین بودند. در آدینه‌ی پس از ماه رمضان، تظاهرات بزرگی در یکی از میدان‌های تهران برگزار شد. حکومت نظامی شده بود. برای پخش کردن مردم تیراندازی شد، نزدیک به سد تن کشته شدند. آن شب، سد آتش‌سوزی در تهران به پا شد. اعتصاب‌ها در کشور آغاز شده بودند. مدرسه‌ها، کارخانه‌ها و حتا صنعت نفت که شاهرگ کشور بود بسته شدند. کشور زمین‌گیر شده بود. در ماه اکتبر شاه آخرین سخنرانی تلویزیونی‌‌اش را داشت. پیمانی با مردم  برای انتخابات آزاد و سپردن کار مردم به نمایندگان‌شان. از اشتباهات گذشته پوزش خواست. گفت: من حافظ سلطنت مشروطه هستم که موهبتی‌ست الهی که از طرف ملت به پادشاه تفویض شده است. او گفت که صدای مردم را شنیده است. دیر شده بود. مردم گوش نمی‌دادند. جادوگر جادویشان کرده بود! شاه تنها یک گزینه داشت. هنوز فرماندهی ارتش در دست او بود. ژنرال‌های ارتش هنوز به او وفادار بودند. نیم میلیون نظامی زیر فرمانش بودند. می‌توانست قدرت را در دست خود نگه دارد، با ریختن خون ایرانیان. همیشه گزینشی هست. سه ماه پس از آن در مجلس در حال گوش دادن به سخنرانی محسن پزشکپور بودم. او پایه‌گذار حزب پان ایرانیست بود. در میانه‌ی سخنرانی‌اش، پیام‌رسان یادداشتی را پشت تریبون مجلس به دست او داد. آنرا  خواند، سپس با صدای بلند پرسید: «به کجا می‌روند؟» آنگاه بسوی مجلس برگشت، و گفت: «شاه از کشور خارج شده است.» حاضران ناباورانه آهی از سینه کشیدند. آنزمان دانستم که دیگر نقشی برای ما نمانده است. شاه رفته بود. پرچم بر خاک افتاده بود. نبرد از دست شده بود. مشکل خودکامگی این است: چادری‌ست که بر یک ستون ایستاده است، ستون را که برداری - همه چیز فرو می‌ریزد.",

  "text": "(31/54) “One of Dr. Ameli’s first acts as Minister of Information was to bring cameras and microphones into parliament. For the first time ever, our speeches would now reach the ears of ordinary Iranians. During the first recorded session I gave a speech. I spoke about the same things I always spoke about. I spoke about 𝘥𝘢𝘢𝘥. About every Iranian getting their fair share. I spoke about 𝘢𝘻𝘢𝘥𝘪. About every Iranian having the chance to participate in the future of their country. For the next week our phone at the house rang off the hook. People were calling me to thank me for my words, people I didn’t even know. But by then it was too late. Khomeini had grown too powerful. So much of the country had received their political education in mosques. They viewed him as a savior; they thought a true Islamic revolution was coming. Opposition groups could sense the wave building, and they rushed to align themselves with Khomeini. They thought that they could mix in their own ideology with his views.  They thought they’d be able to ride the dragon's back, and direct his fire. Even many of the liberal groups were siding with him. Khomeini had been giving interviews. He was telling reporters that he wanted a democracy. He was saying that he would protect the rights of women, and people believed him. He would later claim that Islam allows lying during times of war. One week a rumor spread across the country that Khomeini’s face would be visible in the next full moon. Hundreds of thousands of people went to their rooftops. And hundreds of thousands of people, even educated people, reported seeing his face. On Ramadan nearly a million people marched in Tehran against the king. Our house was on one of Tehran’s main boulevards, so I stood in the doorway to watch the crowd pass. Many were students. They were joyful. They thought that freedom was finally coming to Iran. But the crowd was also filled with young religious men. They were dressed all in black. They would take a few steps, kneel, pray, and then they would rise and do it again. It was like a river, moving in one direction. And Iran was a leaf, floating on top.”\n\nاز نخستین کارهای دکتر عاملی در جایگاه وزیر اطلاعات و جهانگردی آوردن دوربین و میکروفون به مجلس بود. اکنون برای نخستین بار صدای ما به گوش مردم ایران می‌رسید. من در نخستین جلسه‌ی ضبط تلویزیونی سخنرانی کردم. از موضوع‌هایی سخن گفتم که همواره آنها را بیان می‌کردم. از داد سخن گفتم. که هر ایرانی سهمی عادلانه داشته باشد. از آزادی گفتم. که هر ایرانی امکان مشارکت داشته باشد در ساختن کشورش. یک هفته پس از آن تلفن خانه‌ی‌ما بی‌وقفه زنگ می‌زد. مردمی که آنها را نمی‌شناختم از سخنانم قدردانی می‌کردند. ولی دیگر دیر شده و بر قدرت خمینی افزوده شده بود. بسیاری از مردم کشور آموزش سیاسی خود را در مسجدها گرفته بودند. آنها کورکورانه در خمینی یک منجی می‌دیدند. مخالفان شاه احساس کردند که موجی در حال شکل گرفتن است و برای پیوستن به آن شتاب می‌کردند. می‌پنداشتند که می‌توانند عقیده‌هایشان را با نظرات او بیامیزند. گمان می‌کردند که می‌توان بر پشت اژدها سوار شد. در این خیال بودند که می‌توانند آتش او را به جایی که می‌خواهند ببرند. لیبرال‌ها هم با او همگام شده بودند. خمینی در مصاحبه‌ها به خبرنگاران می‌گفت که خواهان دمکراسی است، از حقوق زنان دفاع خواهد کرد. مردم او را باور می‌کردند. او بعدها ادعا کرد که در اسلام دروغ گفتن در هنگامه‌ی جنگ مجاز است. شایعه‌ای در کشور پخش شد که چهره‌ی خمینی در ماه پیداست. هزاران تن به پشت‌بام‌ها رفتند و او را در ماه دیدند. خبرش در صفحه‌ی نخست روزنامه‌ها چاپ شد! در پایان ماه رمضان بسیارانی در تهران بر ضد شاه تظاهرات کردند. فضا آکنده از فریادهای «مرگ بر شاه» شده بود. خانه‌ی ما در یکی از بلوارهای اصلی تهران قرار داشت، از این رو در آستانه‌ی در ایستادم تا حرکت جمعیت را تماشا کنم. بسیاری دانشجو بودند. شادمان بودند. باور داشتند که سرانجام آزادی به ایران می‌آید. ولی بیشتر آنان مردان جوان مذهبی بودند. سیاه‌پوش. گامی چند برمی‌داشتند، زانو می‌زدند، سر به سجده می‌گذاشتند، بلند می‌شدند و این کار را تکرار می‌کردند. مانند رودخانه‌ای بود روان و ایران چون برگی شناور بر آب",

  "text": "(30/54) “We were at the eighteenth birthday party of our daughter Ahang when we learned that a crowded movie theater had been set on fire in the town of Abadan. The arsonists had locked the exits from the outside, and four hundred people were killed. It was the largest act of terrorism in the history of Iran. Later it would be discovered that the arsonists were religious fanatics. But Khomeini was able to convince much of the country that the fire had been started by SAVAK, at the order of the king. The riots continued to grow. And the king began to panic. He called for the formation of a new government and fired his ministers. He wanted to replace them with upright people. People who could inspire confidence. People who could not be corrupted. And there was one member of parliament that was trusted most of all. He lived in a simple house. He drove a beat-up car. Nobody could question Dr. Ameli’s integrity. The king asked him to join the new administration as Minister of Information. In his new position he would be responsible for investigating the Abadan fire. If he discovered something that implicated Khomeini, I knew he would become a marked man. I drove to his office. I begged him to turn down the position. I told him: ‘Things have become too dangerous. Let’s stay low, let’s keep in our bunker. Once things have calmed down, we can reemerge. We can take a stand and make our case to the people.’ Thirty years earlier we had sworn an oath, to give our lives for Iran. The years had changed him in so many ways. There was white in his hair now. He was a respected leader. He’d written and spoken on every facet of Iran’s society and history. His thoughts had evolved. His policies had evolved. But his ideals had never changed. Every choice he made, he made for Iran. Every choice. He listened politely while I made my case. He knew. Deep in his heart he knew. He knew even better than I did. If something happened to the king, he was done. He’d have no protection. He’d have no support. But he had already made his decision. He was going to serve.” \n\nما سرگرم جشن هجدهمین زادروز دخترمان آهنگ بودیم که دریافتیم سینمای بزرگی در شهر آبادان به آتش کشیده شده است. آتش‌افروزان درهای خروجی را از بیرون قفل کردند، و بیش از چهارسد تن را سوزاندند. این بزرگترین کار تبهکارانه‌ی تروریستی در تاریخ ایران بود. دیرتر آشکار شد که آتش‌افروزان از تندروهای مذهبی بودند. خمینی و یاران تبهکارش به سادگی توانستند به بسیاری بباورانند که آتش‌سوزی کار ساواک بوده است و به فرمان شاه. پیروانش بیش از پیش خشمگین شدند. شورش‌ها رو به فزونی بود. شاه ترسیده بود. نخست وزیر را برکنار کرد و دولت جدیدی سر کار آمد. می‌خواست دولتی درخور اعتماد مردم باشد، دنبال درست‌کردارانی می‌گشت که به عنوان وزیر خدمت کنند. کسانی که آلوده به فساد نبودند. آنانی را که به درستی شهرت داشتند. دکتر عاملی پزشکی توانا، استاد دانشگاه و نماینده‌ی مجلس بود که در خانه‌ای ساده به سادگی می‌زیست و خودروی فرسوده‌ای را می‌راند. مردی ستودنی بود. شاه از او خواست که به دولت جدید به عنوان وزیر اطلاعات و جهانگردی بپیوندد. در آن جایگاه وی سرپرست بررسی حادثه‌ی آتش‌سوزی سینما رکس آبادان بود. او بود که باید تبهکاران را پیدا کند و چنین کاری جانش را در خطر می‌انداخت. هنگامی که شنیدم به او چنین پیشنهادی شده است به دیدنش رفتم و نگرانی‌ام را یادآوری کردم و گفتم بهتر است که ما در سنگر خود بمانیم. سی سال از سوگندی که در همراهی با او برای جان باختن در راه ایران یاد کرده بودم، می‌گذشت. موهایش اندکی به سپیدی گراییده، گرانمایه‌ای ارجمند بود. درباره‌ی تمامی زمینه‌های جامعه و تاریخ ایران نوشته و سخنرانی داشت. اندیشه‌ها و سیاستش پخته‌تر شده و آرمان‌هایش همچنان استوار و پا بر جا بودند. هر تصمیم و گزینشش برای ایران بود. او ‌به سخنانم با ادب و بزرگی همیشگی‌اش گوش داد. می‌دانست، در ژرفای قلبش می‌دانست که اگر سلطنت شاه به خطر افتد، کار او نیز تمام است. از من بهتر می‌دانست که دیگر پناهگاهی نخواهد داشت. ولی او راهش را برگزیده بود. باید خدمت می‌کرد.",

International friends from India, Poland and Brazil who were studying with me at the time really helped. And it was such a blessed relief. No more lies, doubts, self-loathing, or feeling guilty for being a practicing Christian and Catholic and loving men. I finally found the happiness of being true to myself. But, as a Mangalorean-Indian boy, coming out at 19 was a huge shock and disappointment to my parents. They took me to a doctor in India to see if I could be ‘cured’. Thankfully he didn't try, but he also didn't tell my parents that it's normal to be gay. So for years after that, to be a good son and for my parents' happiness, I had to keep hiding my wings. \n\n\"The UK was my saving grace, my haven to be free. But whenever my parents asked about my life here I had to lie, and that's not me. I've always worn my heart on my sleeve. When I got my first job here, at 22, I finally found the confidence to stand up to them and insist on being open about myself. I think they'd buried it down deep and were just hoping I'd turn straight. After lots of heated talks and arguments, and some counselling from video calls with other Indian parents of gay kids, they finally accepted it. But they still didn't want their circle of friends and family back in India to know. \n\n\"In December last year I invited them over to stay with me and my partner Sugith, because we now live together, we've decided to form a civil partnership, and I wanted them to get to know him and see that our life together was as 'normal' as any straight couple. They've been with us for a few months now, but they were still refusing to tell the rest of my family the truth. They'd just say \"We will tell everyone in a few years when people ask why you aren't getting married”.\n\nJoyston, photographed in Pitville Park and January's snow (1/3)",

  "text": "(29/54) “The riots began in Qom. One day Khomeini gave a speech saying that the moment had arrived for a true Islamic revolution. And that it was the duty of all Muslims to oppose the monarchy. The rioters targeted anything they deemed anti-Islamic: cinemas, liquor stores, shops selling Western clothes. When the police tried to crack down, a few of the rioters were killed. Khomeini declared the men to be martyrs, and forty days later a public memorial was held. Huge crowds came out. And the rioting began again. It was as constant as the beat of a drum: riots, deaths, memorial. Riots, deaths, memorial. Every forty days there would be another wave. And with every wave the destruction would grow. Eventually the riots spread to the capital. Many mornings I would walk to parliament because the traffic was so bad. One morning I was forced to take a different route entirely, because rioters were destroying a liquor store. They were breaking hundreds of bottles in the street, and the gutters were filled with liquor. My colleagues in parliament were nervous, but I was optimistic. I thought this might even be an opportunity for us. Our entire careers we’d been in the opposition. We often spoke against the king’s policies. Now the people were mobilized. They were in the streets. They were looking for an alternative. Maybe this would be the moment that the king would finally hear the voice of the people. Maybe this would be the moment for us to have a true constitutional monarchy. Khomeini wanted to bring Iran back to the dark ages.  But I knew that Khomeini didn’t represent the Muslims of Iran. Iran had been Islamic for one thousand years. We were the nation of Rumi. The nation of Hafez. These fanatics did not represent our religion. I even gave a speech from the podium of Parliament where I quoted the Koran. It was the words of Allah: ‘Those who are furthest from evil, are closest to me.” \n\nشورش‌ها از قم آغاز شد. خمینی در سخنرانی خود گفت که زمان برای انقلاب اسلامی واقعی فرا رسیده است. وظیفه‌ی همه‌ی مسلمانان است که ضد سلطنت به پا خیزند. شورشیان آنچه را غیراسلامی می‌پنداشتند هدف می‌گرفتند: سینماها، فروشگاه‌های مشروبات الکلی، فروشگاه‌هایی که لباس‌های غربی می‌فروختند. در تلاش شهربانی برای خاموش کردن شورش‌ها، شماری ازشورشیان کشته می‌شدند. خمینی کشته‌شدگان را شهید می‌خواند. چهل روز پس از آن، مراسم یادبود برگزار می‌شد و جمعیت زیادی در آن شرکت می‌کردند. مانند کوبش پیاپی طبل صحنه‌ها تکرار می‌شد: شورش، مرگ، سوگواری. شورش، مرگ، سوگواری. هر چهل روز موج تازه‌ای به راه می‌افتاد. و با هر موج تازه ویرانی‌های بیشتری. سرانجام شورش‌ها به تهران کشید. بیشتر صبح‌ها پیاده به مجلس می‌رفتم زیرا ترافیک بدی بود. یک بار مجبور شدم راهم را تغییر دهم چون شورشیان در کار تخریب فروشگاه مشروبات الکلی بودند. آنها بطری‌ها را در خیابان می‌شکستند و در جوی‌‌ها می‌ریختند. همکاران من در مجلس نگران بودند، من هنوز خوشبین بودم. شاید فرصتی باشد. بسیار پیش آمده بود که ضد برخی سیاست‌های کشور سخن گفته بودم. بودن مردم در خیابانها روزنه‌ی امیدی بود که سرانجام به ‌پادشاهی مشروطه برسیم. تلاش می‌کردم گروه کوچک همفکرانم را در مجلس آسوده‌خاطر سازم. می‌دانستم که خمینی نماینده‌ی مسلمانان ایران نیست. هزار سال از اسلامی شدن ایران می‌گذشت. ما ملت مولانا بودیم. ما ملت حافظ بودیم. این تندروان نماینده‌ی دین ما نبودند. حتا در یک سخنرانی در مجلس نقل قولی از قرآن آوردم. گفتم: کسانی برای خدا گرامی‌ترند ‌که از بدی‌ها دورترند",

  "text": "(28/54) “The king loved Iran. And I believed him when he claimed that it was his dream to have a more open society one day. With a truly free press. And truly free elections. But he didn’t think Iran was ready. It was fear. So many foreign powers were trying to control Iran. The country was full of spies. He’d already survived two assassination attempts, and he saw enemies everywhere. I never viewed myself as an enemy of the king. There was only one thing I wanted. It was the same thing I’d wanted since I was a little boy, when I saw him for the first time. When I touched his coat. I wanted him to be a good king. I wanted him to respect the constitution. I wanted him to involve the people, and hear our voice. On the day of his visit I was excited to welcome him to Nahavand. I wanted to show him that we were trusting the people to make their own choices, their own decisions. I arrived early to the airport. The king’s handlers explained how the welcoming ceremony would proceed. I was to stand on the tarmac about fifty meters from where the king’s helicopter was supposed to land. He would speak to me first. And then he would go on to speak to a crowd of dignitaries gathered behind me. I walked out to my assigned spot. I was out there all alone, with a crowd of fifty people watching. I had my quote from Shahnameh ready. It’s from the moment that Rostam welcomes Prince Esfandiyar. He says: ‘𝘉𝘭𝘦𝘴𝘴𝘦𝘥 𝘪𝘴 𝘺𝘰𝘶𝘳 𝘵𝘩𝘳𝘰𝘯𝘦. 𝘈𝘯𝘥 𝘣𝘭𝘦𝘴𝘴𝘦𝘥 𝘢𝘳𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘱𝘦𝘰𝘱𝘭𝘦 𝘰𝘧 𝘐𝘳𝘢𝘯, 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘺 𝘢𝘳𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘨𝘶𝘢𝘳𝘥𝘪𝘢𝘯𝘴 𝘰𝘧 𝘪𝘵𝘴 𝘧𝘶𝘵𝘶𝘳𝘦.’ When the helicopter landed, the king stepped out. He gave a quick salute to his military escort. And then he began to walk my way. I had my words ready, but I did not get to speak them. He did not stop. He did not slow down. He didn’t even look me in the eye.” \n\n(۲۸) شاه عاشق ایران بود. می‌گفت می‌خواهد روزی جامعه‌ی ایران آزاد باشد با رسانه‌های آزاد. انتخاباتی به راستی آزاد و من او را باور داشتم. ولی بر آن بود که ایران هنوز آماده نیست. ترس بود. قدرت‌های خارجی بسیاری در تلاش برای کنترل ایران بودند. شاه تا آن زمان از دو سوءقصد جان به در برده بود. دشمن را همه جا می‌دید. من هرگز دشمن پادشاه نبودم. تنها یک چیز می‌خواستم. همان چیزی که در زمان کودکی، روزی که او را دیدم، آن روز که کت او را لمس کردم، می‌خواستم. می‌خواستم شاه خوبی باشد. می‌خواستم که به قانون اساسی احترام بگذارد، می‌خواستم که مردم را در کارها شریک کند و صدایمان را بشنود. مشتاقانه چشم به راه ورودش بودم. می‌خواستم به او نشان دهم که می‌توان مردم را مشارکت داد و به تصمیم‌گیری‌های‌شان اعتماد کرد. در روز بازدید او از نهاوند به محل فرود هلیکوپترش رفتم. مدیران تشریفات شاه مرا به فاصله‌ی پنجاه متر از جایی که قرار بود هلیکوپتر فرود آید، راهنمایی کردند. به من گفتند که شاه نخست با من گفت‌وگو می‌کند، سپس به ملاقات با دیگر سرکردگان و نمایندگان گروه‌های مختلف و بانوان شهر خواهد رفت. من به جایگاه تعیین شده‌ام رفتم و ایستادم، تک و‌تنها، جدا از پنجاه تن افرادی که برای پیشواز شاه آمده بودند. بیتی از شاهنامه را آماده کرده بودم که خوش‌آمد رستم به اسفندیار است: خنک شهر ایران که تخت تو را   /   پرستند و بیدار بخت تو را. هنگامی که هلیکوپتر بر زمین نشست، شاه پیاده شد. گزارش نظامی را شنید. سپس به سوی من راه افتاد. سخنانم را آماده کرده بودم ولی فرصتی نیافتم که بیان‌شان کنم. او توقف نکرد. آهنگش را آهسته نکرد. حتا نگاهی هم نینداخت.",

  "text": "(27/54) “One morning I was called into the Speaker’s office along with another colleague. We were told that he’d received a call from the king’s office, and the king needed our two votes on an upcoming issue. My colleague was silent. But I replied: ‘I cannot do it. If I was a soldier of the king, I would crawl across the floor at his command. But I am a representative of the people. And I answer only to them.’ When I looked over, my colleague had tears in his eyes. Nobody disobeyed a direct request from the king. But Iran was a constitutional monarchy. We had a constitution. That was supposed to mean something. It had to mean something—or we were left with nothing but a king. I knew I wasn’t helping my career. The parliament was a corrupted system, and the only way to advance was to support the king. But I wasn’t there to be part of the system. I was there to scream 𝘈𝘻𝘢𝘥𝘪. Freedom. One afternoon the Speaker told me that the king would be making a trip to Nahavand, and I should be there to greet him at the airport.  I searched Shahnameh for the perfect quote to welcome him. I chose from one of my favorite stories: the story of Rostam and Esfandiyar. In this story Rostam is a much older man. He’s served many kings. But the current king has turned oppressive, and Rostam refuses to obey his commands. The king sends his son Esfandiyar to arrest Rostam. Esfandiyar promises Rostam that the king only wishes to set an example. He says: ‘Please, just let me bind your hands.’ He promises that he’ll immediately be released. He promises Rostam all the riches of the kingdom, if only he’ll allow his hands to be bound. Esfandiyar is protected by a divine blessing. He has never been beaten in battle. And Rostam knows that if they fight, he will almost certainly die. But still, he will not allow his hands to be bound.  He’d never give up his 𝘢𝘻𝘢𝘥𝘪. Here Ferdowsi shows his genius. The dialogue is rich. The men dine together. They share wine. They flatter each other. Each man does everything to persuade the other to change his mind. But their fate was already written. They would battle to the death. Because one could not disobey his king. And the other could not disobey his code.” \n\nبامدادی همراه یکی از همکاران به دفتر رئیس مجلس فراخوانده شدیم.  گفت که از دفتر شاه پیامی رسیده که می‌خواهد ما در رأی‌گیری پیش‌ رو رأی موافق بدهیم.گفتم: «اگر من سرباز شاه می‌بودم، سینه‌خیز از این سو به آن سو می‌رفتم و فرمانش را می‌‌‌پذیرفتم ولی من نماینده‌ی مردمم.» اشک در چشمان همکارم بود. رئیس برآشفته گفت: “یکبار بر سر بحرین دوستان شما مرا بدبخت کردند و امروز شما.” سرپیچی از درخواست شاه کم‌سابقه بود. قانون اساسی ایران سلطنت مشروطه بود و این باید گویای واقعیتی باشد. هنگامی که سیاست‌های شاه به سود ایران باشد، نخستین کسی هستم که از آنها پشتیبانی کنم ولی کشور نمی‌تواند بر پایه‌ی یک اندیشه اداره شود. اگر آن اندیشه خردمندانه هم باشد. هر چیز می‌باید با اندیشه‌های گوناگون بررسی شود. بسیاری شنیده شوند تا مردمان دریابند که شهریاران میهنند. پیام رئیس مجلس خبر از آمدن شاه به نهاوند می‌داد و می‌خواست اگر بتوانم آنجا باشم. خبر خوبی بود. نهاوند نیازمندی‌هایی داشت. می‌شد آنها را در میان گذاشت. شاهنامه را زیر و رو کردم تا بهترین پیام خوش‌آمد‌‌گویی را بیابم. پیامم را در یکی از داستان‌های دلپسندم یافتم، داستان رستم و اسفندیار. در این داستان رستم مردی‌ست سالخورده. شاهان بسیاری را یاری کرده است. ولی آنگاه که پادشاه زمانه ستمگر ‌شود، از فرمانبرداری او سر می‌پیچد. گشتاسب پسرش اسفندیار را می‌فرستد تا دست رستم را ببندد و نزد او‌ ببرد. اسفندیار خواهان جنگ نیست. اسفندیار به رستم چنین خوش‌آمد می‌گوید: که یزدان سپاس ای جهان پهلوان   /   که دیدم ترا شاد و روشن روان   /   سزاوار باشد ستودن ترا   /   یلان جهان خاک بودن ترا   /   خنک آنکه او را بود چون تو پشت   /   بیاساید از روزگار درشت. اسفندیار رویین‌تن است و هرگز تا آن روز شکست نخورده است. رستم می‌داند که در صورت نبرد، کشته خواهد شد ولی نمی‌پذیرد دستانش بسته شوند زیرا هرگز از آزادی خود نمی‌گذرد. در اینجا نبوغ فردوسی هویداست. گفت‌وگوی این دو بسیار پر بار است. به ستایش یکدیگر می‌پردازند. رستم اینچنین به ستایش اسفندیار می‌پردازد: خنک شاه کو چون تو‌ دارد پسر   /   به بالا و فرت بنازد پدر   /   همه ساله بخت تو پیروز باد   /   شبان سیه بر تو ‌نوروز باد   /   دو ‌گردن‌فرازیم پیر و جوان   /   خردمند و بیدار، دو پهلوان. آنها به هر تلاشی دست می یازند تا رای دیگری را برگردانند ولی سرنوشت آنها نوشته شده است. وارد نبردی مرگبار خواهند شد زیرا یکی از پادشاهی خود نمی گذرد و دیگری از آرمانش",

Because being me as I am now is way better than not being here at all. I've had 2 more children and I've had a whole life since then. For 15 years I did really struggle because I wasn't getting the help I needed. Like so many disabled people, I had to fight hard for that. But for the past few years I've had my care package, my wheelchair and an accessible house, and I've been able to live a pretty normal independent life again.\n\n\"I've also been involved in a lot of activism for disabled people, as well as for transgender people because I'm non-binary myself. I've been part of a campaign against introducing Assisted Suicide because we'd rather people were helped to have better lives, to have some of their unneccessary suffering taken away, rather than just making it easier for them to die early. When the things that are manageable have been managed, and you no longer feel like you're a burden, then the things that are left to cope with are so much easier. It's not that you never get down again. I don't wake up every morning and go 'Hurrah, I love being disabled!' Actually, I tend to wake up and go 'Oh God, I'm in such pain!' but my second thought is 'Well, if it hurts then I'm still alive' and I'm really glad about that.\"\n\nDennis, met by Richard in Trafalgar Square.\n\nThrowback to November 2018.",

She also gave me an image which stayed with me: 'Think of your mind as a busy station and your thoughts as trains. You don't have to jump on the first train that pulls in. You can let it pass and wait for a better one.' Then Amar, who's been my best mate since college, told me all the skits and silly characters we were always making up together were actually a theatre form called ‘Improv’...and signed us up for a course! I was so scared the first day but I quickly learnt everyone had the same fears and no-one was going to make me feel embarrassed or ashamed. That was so liberating. It’s never ego-driven because you’re a team, supporting each other and constantly passing the torch to someone else. You have to be emotionally honest and really listen, understand, engage and collaborate. It forces you to be entirely in the moment, which I never was with my anxiety. It was an outlet for my creativity I didn't know I needed, and it's given me a confidence I hadn’t felt for a long time and helped me feel good about who I am. \n\n\"I was able to stop taking the antidepressants soon after I started doing it, and I feel so lucky to have so many more great friends who I can really open up to, rather than keeping it all inside, consumed by doubts. Going back into therapy has also been a lifeline for me over the past year and has helped me to start repairing my relationship with my dad. Another blessing is that I've been able to take some time out, thanks to being furloughed and then made redundant, plus my dad giving me and my sister most of the money his mother left to him too, which was an unbelievable thing for him to do. So I've been free to focus on myself, what's really important to me, and be more creative without worrying about how I'm going to pay the bills. I've started making Acrylic paint-pouring art (see below), because when you're mixing colours you get all these wonderful moments of blending which are so beautiful. Now I'm hoping I can find a different job which I can leave behind at 6pm and still have the energy to be creative at home.\" \n\nStefan, photographed by Amar in Soho (2/2)",

  "text": "(1/2) \"7 years ago I started suffering really bad anxiety attacks. My stomach would turn and I'd have to rush to the nearest toilet. So I started to be afraid of leaving home or being stuck on public transport. I'd just ended my 8-year relationship with my ex, Sarah. We'd been together since finishing Uni and, although she's a lovely person and luckily we're still very good friends, I felt we were moving in different directions and that if we got a place together as she wanted we'd just make each other miserable. I knew it was the right decision, but it was still really hard to make. Suddenly I was adrift in the world by myself, not knowing what I wanted, or what direction to go in, and with this big hole in my life. Also, working as an architectural model-maker was often really stressful, with very long work hours and lots of pressure for not much reward. I was prescribed anti-depressants to help me cope, and I enrolled on a CBT course to try and get a better understanding of who and how I was. \n\n\"My parents separated when I was 2-and-a-half and my sister was 4. Mum got custody of us and worked so hard to give us stability and support, really putting us ahead of herself. I could always talk to and laugh with her and she was a great comfort. But my father conformed to the old male stereotype of being macho, driven and competitive, and I felt a lot of pressure from him. He could get very stressed and angry, and always seemed to put his own needs first. So I remember thinking 'I really don't want to be like that'. A few years ago he pretty much brought me to tears when, instead of giving me the parental help I was asking for, he made me feel a deep sense of shame for not being able to sort it out by myself. My sister has her own reasons to be angry with him, and growing up I felt like piggy-in-the-middle, constantly trying to negotiate peace between them and support them both. I think I damped down my own emotions as I didn't want to cause even more trouble. When confronted about how his parenting had affected us, his favourite excuse was 'No-one gives you a parenting handbook when you have children.'\"\n\nStefan, photographed by Amar in Soho (1/2)",

It makes me angry more than fearful, because I don't think fear is going to get me anywhere. \n\n\"The vigil was very peaceful, eerily quiet and beautiful, while I was there. It wasn't a formal event as the original organisers hadn't been allowed to go ahead. I left as it got dark as I felt I'd made my tribute and honoured Sarah and the vigil. There were a lot of police there and, as we were leaving, they were starting to ask people to move on or be fined. It was a shame that it turned to scenes of such aggression. I believe the police had an opportunity to work with the community and the organisers to have a safe event and because they didn't, it turned something peaceful into violence.\"\n\nAmanda, who posted up these 10 beautiful photos yesterday with these words below: \n\n💔For Sarah💔 There are not enough words to describe this. How utterly heart broken so many of us, especially in our area, have been for Sarah, her family and her friends. She was just walking home. Something we all do. Something we shouldn't have to overthink but we do.\n\nThen there is the rage. Rage that it took losing another life in the fight to stop violence against women to remind society how far we still have to go. Rage that so many other women still haven't been served justice or found. Rage that 97% of all young women in the UK have been sexually harassed. Rage for victim blaming. Rage for not believing women.\n\nThe sun shone gloriously on the flower-covered bandstand and the sunset glowed for the minute silence. It was a powerful, beautiful, heartbreaking moment. Sarah, this is for you 💔💔💔🕯️🕯️🕯️#iamsarah\n\nAll photos by Amanda Summons Photography + Design",

  "text": "(2/2) \"In 2005, after graduating from a Film course, I met Charlene. She was working with my sister who'd been talking about my accident. One day at home I jokingly grabbed the phone to say 'Hi', and we ended up speaking all night. The next day we met up at Tate Modern and just clicked. She never mentioned my speech impediment or all my scars, and she hasn’t tried to fix me. She allowed me to open up in my own time and helped me to explore my darker emotions too. As Nick Yarris said 'You can only grow so far as a man until a woman teaches you enough about yourself that you can develop further'. In 2007-8 we went travelling around the world together and this had a restorative impact on me. It really opened my eyes to how huge and culturally diverse the world is, and reconnected me with nature and the cycles of life and energy too.\n\n\"We got married in 2014 and she's a large part of why I'm mentally stable today. Now we have our baby girls Amina and Ruby, who are 3 years and 7 months old. They feel like the most incredible gifts and have not only given me a new passion in life, but forced me to deal with my demons to become a better father, husband and man. My family and friends have given me incredible support and, about 8 years after the accident, I finally found the courage to go and see Michelle's family. Her mother and children welcomed me with open arms. I was amazed by their warmth and compassion, and was so relieved to find they didn't despise me as I'd expected. Learning to do yoga really helped calm my rage at being thrust into such a situation, as did finding The Brain Institute and Headway. That was such a humbling education as I met so many people who'd also suffered life-changing head traumas and were struggling with the complex and unpredictable effects as much as me. Now, after 20 years of filling notebooks with everything I would say to Michelle, I've collated them into a monologue screenplay and am looking for an experienced producer to help me get it filmed. I gained such strength from hearing others' stories of survival that I'm hoping mine can be of service by helping others to return from despair too.\"\n\nLee, photographed by Amar in Soho (2/2)",

  "text": "(26/54) “Mitra was the oldest in her class, but all the younger students loved her. She knew all the latest in culture: the movies, the magazines, the trends. Every night when I came home she’d always be up listening to tapes. The seventies were a golden age of music in Iran: Googoosh, Delkash, Marzieh, Aslani, Hayedeh, Shajarian. And Mitra had many of their songs memorized. She was a great student. During the second year of her program she was chosen to study under one of Iran’s top Shahnameh professors. It was the closest she ever came to understanding me. One day in class the professor told her that every society needs a few idealists, because they’re the ones who move society forward. Often I would help with her homework, and it helped me view Shahnameh from a more academic perspective. Ferdowsi uses the mythic kings as placeholders for periods in Iran’s history. When he writes that Jamshid ruled for seven hundred years, he means that it was a time of great freedom and culture in Iran. But when Jamshid loses touch with the people, a period of terror and oppression follows. The throne is taken over by the Serpent King Zahak. In Shahnameh Zahak is the embodiment of darkness. He cares only for his own power. Two giant snakes grow out of his shoulders. The devil promises Zahak that he will stay in power, as long as he feeds the snakes with the brains of young Iranians. It had to be the brains of the young. Because young people are the ones with energy. They’re the ones with courage. They’re the ones that can overthrow the regime. One day twenty students at Mitra’s school entered the cafeteria wearing masks, and began to forcibly separate men and women. They physically assaulted any women who were wearing make-up or Western clothing. On the way out they scattered pamphlets on the floor, warning that all women should adhere to Islamic guidelines—or there will be consequences. An atmosphere of fear began to spread across the campus. Mitra began wearing a hijab to school. She chose a beautiful white one, made of silk.” \n\nمیترا از همکلاسی‌هایش مسن‌تر بود، همکلاسی‌های کم‌سن‌وسال‌تر او را دوست داشتند. دایره‌ی دوستانش گسترش یافت. میترا از تازه‌ترین رویدادهای فرهنگی با خبر بود: فیلم‌ها، روزنامه‌ها و گرایش‌ها. شبها که به خانه بر‌می‌گشتم او را در حال شنیدن نوارهای کاست می‌دیدم. دهه‌ی هفتاد دوران طلایی موسیقی بود: گوگوش، دلکش، مرضیه، اصلانی، هایده، شجریان و ... میترا بیشتر ترانه‌های آنها را از بر داشت. در سال دوم دانشگاه، کلاسی را برگزید که استادش یکی از برجسته‌ترین استادان شاهنامه‌شناسی دانشگاه تهران بود. سالی بود که میترا را بیش از همیشه به اندیشه‌هایم نزدیک می‌دیدم. روزی استادش گفته بود که همه‌ی جامعه‌ها نیازمند آرمانخواهان‌اند زیرا آنها هستند که جامعه را پیش می‌رانند. اگر فرصتی دست می‌داد، در درس شاهنامه یاری‌اش می‌دادم. این کار برایم خوشایند بود. کمک کرد تا داستان‌های شاهنامه را از دیدگاه دانشگاهی بکاوم. دریافتم که فردوسی پادشاهان افسانه‌ای را بسان نمایندگان بازه‌های زمانی برگزیده است. هنگامی که می‌نویسد پادشاهی جمشید هفتسد سال به درازا کشید، منظور او دوران آزادی‌های فراوان و گسترش پرشکوه ایران و فرهنگ ایرانی‌ست. ولی پیوند جمشید با مردم گسسته می‌شود. فر او می‌کاهد و تخت پادشاهی به ضحاک می‌رسد. ضحاک نماد تاریکی‌ست. خودکامه‌ای ستمگر است. دو مار بزرگ بر شانه‌های او می‌رویند. اهریمن به ضحاک می‌گوید تا  زمانی که مارها را با مغز جوانان سیر نگه دارد، آسوده خواهی زیست زیرا جوانان  نیرومند، آرزومند و دلیرند! جوانان می‌توانند حاکمان ستمگر را سرنگون کنند. یک روز  بیست دانشجو  وارد سالن غذاخوری دانشگاه شدند و به زور مردان و زنان را از هم جدا کردند. آنها به زنانی که آرایش‌ کرده و لباس غربی پوشیده بودند، یورش بردند. هنگام بیرون رفتن از سالن غذاخوری، بیانیه‌هایی بر زمین ریختند که به زنان هشدار می‌داد، می‌بایستی به  احکام اسلامی پایبند یا در انتظار پی‌آمدهایی ناگوار باشند. ترس در پردیس دانشگاه گسترده شد. میترا حجاب بر سر کرد. او روسری ابریشمین سپیدرنگی را برگزید",

  "text": "(25/54) “There is a game that Mitra and I would often play. One of us would recite a verse from a poem. Then whatever letter that verse ended with, the other person would think of a verse that began with that letter. We’d go back and forth until someone got stuck. And Mitra could not be beaten. Her memory was a library of Persian poetry. When our children were older she applied to the literature program at the University of Tehran. It was a very selective program, but she received one of the highest possible scores on the admissions test. Some mornings I’d drop her off at school on my way to parliament. She’d have me drop her off down the street, because she didn’t want to be seen with a parliamentarian. The college campuses in Tehran had become a hotbed of political protest. With his White Revolution the king had provided free education to the children of Iran. Now those children were grown, and they wanted a say in the future of their country. Many wanted more freedom. They wanted truly free elections. They wanted an end to censorship, an end to political persecution, an end to SAVAK. Others thought the king had brought too many freedoms to Iran: the capitalism, the tight clothes, the violent movies. It was too much, too fast. They wanted a return to tradition. And Islam became a rallying point. But this was the Islam of our fathers. An Iranian Islam. The Islam of Rumi. The Islam of Hafez. During our next break from Parliament I visited a bookshop. The owner reached beneath his desk and pulled out a book by Khomeini-- the cleric from Qom who had incited the riots in Tehran. Khomeini had been sent into exile by the king, but he still had a large following in the country. His speeches were smuggled into the country on cassettes and sold in the bazaar. In his book he called for an Islamic dictatorship. He talked about returning to ‘the source’ of Islam. Sharia Law. It was an Islam from fourteen hundred years ago. An Islam of cutting off hands, oppression of women, and death for non-believers. He said that ‘Islam provides a law for every aspect of human life.’ But he did not say how the law would be enforced. That he said, would be figured out later.” \n\nگاهی میترا و من با یکدیگر مشاعره می‌کردیم. با بیتی آغاز می‌شد. آخرین حرف بیت می‌بایستی نخستین حرف بیت بعدی باشد، تا آنجا ادامه می‌یافت که یکی نتواند بیتی به یاد آورد. هیچگاه نتوانستم میترا را شکست دهم. حافظه‌ی او کتابخانه‌ی کوچکی از شعر فارسی بود. هنگامی که فرزندانمان بزرگ‌تر شدند، میترا تصمیم گرفت در رشته‌ی ادبیات دانشگاه تهران نام‌نویسی کند. رشته‌ای گزینشی بود، آزمون را به خوبی گذراند. روزهایی در مسیر کارم او را به دانشگاه می‌رساندم. از من می‌خواست کمی دورتر از دانشگاه او را پیاده کنم. نمی‌خواست با همکلاسی‌های جوانش که با اتوبوس می‌آمدند فرقی داشته باشد. درباره‌ی من به آنها چیزی نمی‌گفت. دانشگاه‌های تهران کانون ناآرامی‌ها و اعتراض‌های سیاسی شده بودند. آموزش رایگان برای همه‌ فراهم بود. اکنون کودکان بزرگ‌شده می‌خواستند نقشی در آینده‌ی سرزمینشان داشته باشند. امیدبخش بود. بسیاری خواهان آزادی بیشتر و سانسور کمتر ،نبود آزار و اذیت سیاسی و ساواک بودند. گروهی دیگر بر این باور بودند که شاه بیش از اندازه به مردم آزادی داده است. می‌گفتند ایران غرب‌زده شده است: مادی‌گرایی، لباس‌های تنگ و فیلم‌های خشن در زمانی بسیار کوتاه. می‌خواستند به سنت‌های مذهبی برگردند. اسلام انگیزه‌ای برای رسیدن به این خواست‌ها شد. حجاب به نمادی از اعتراض‌های سیاسی تبدیل شد. ولی اسلام پدران ما اسلام ایرانی بود. اسلام مولانا و حافظ. تابستان بود، به کتاب‌فروشی بازار تجریش رفتم. فروشنده دستش را زیر میز برد و کتابی از خمینی بیرون آورد، تازه به دستش رسیده بود. او را از سال ۱۹۶۳ از ایران بیرون کرده بودند ولی هنوز طرفدارانی در کشور داشت. سخنرانی‌هایش بر روی نوار کاست به صورت مخفیانه و قاچاق به کشور وارد می‌شدند و در بازار به فروش می‌رسیدند. او در کتابش خواهان یک دیکتاتوری اسلامی بود. بازگشت به اسلام نخستین، اسلام ۱۴۰۰ سال پیش. اسلام بریدن دست‌ها، مهار کردن زنان، چندهمسری، سرکوب دگراندیشان، از میان بردن آزادی‌های اجتماعی و فرهنگی و مرگ برای ناباوران. او می‌گفت که اسلام برای هر بخشی از زندگی انسان‌ها قانونی دارد ولی هرگز نگفت چگونه آن قانون‌ها اجرا خواهند شد. آن را به آینده‌ی تاریکی سپرد که هنوز در آن گرفتاریم",

  "text": "(24/54) “One afternoon the empress and prince attended a session of parliament. It was an important day. Everyone was hoping to make a strong impression, and I’d prepared a speech especially for the occasion. I was the last speaker on the schedule. The Speaker of Parliament saw me approaching the podium and tried to wave me off. When I kept coming, he hurriedly adjourned the session. I think some of my colleagues viewed me as an annoyance. I’d developed a reputation for speaking my mind. And whenever I could speak, I spoke. I gave a speech on every budget, every proposal, every vote. The topic was always different. But the theme was always the same: 𝘋𝘢𝘢𝘥. Justice. The word that appears most in Shahnameh. Everyone gets what they deserve. One day I gave a speech saying I’d been informed that Iran’s highest-ranking admiral had used a battleship to import Italian furniture. I asked how we could allow such corruption, from a man with a breast full of public service medals. The crowd was silent. It was unheard of to criticize the military, because it was in the hands of the king. But I wanted to show that I was not afraid to speak. So that other Iranians would feel free to share their thoughts. My words were never heard in the media. If there was ever a mention in the newspaper, it would only say: the representative from Nahavand gave a speech. But still, I spoke. I always had hope that I’d find a way to be heard. There is an Iranian proverb about ‘words that fly.’ It says that if words are false, if they are self-serving, if they come from ambition: they will never fly. Even if they’re shouted from loudspeakers. Even if everyone says them at the exact same time: they will soon be forgotten. For they have no soul. They have no 𝘫𝘢𝘢𝘯. But if a person can find the right words. If the words have 𝘢𝘩𝘢𝘯𝘨, if the words have 𝘬𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘥, if the words have 𝘳𝘢𝘴𝘵𝘪- they will grow wings. And they will fly. Even if they’re censored; they will fly. Even if they are silenced; they will fly. Even if they are buried deep in the ground; they will still fly. And they will reach the doorstep of every household.” \n\nبعد‌ از ظهر شهبانو و شاهزاده به نشست مجلس آمده بودند. روز مهمی بود. بودجه‌ی سال آینده در مجلس بررسی می‌شد. نمایندگان رسانه‌ها برای گزارش این رخداد دعوت شده بودند. من شب پیش در رویارویی با نخست وزیر در زمینه‌ی قانون «از کجا آورده‌ای» بگو مگو داشتم. در آنجا سخنان تندی میان ما رد و بدل شده بود. رئیس مجلس ترسیده بود که من در هنگام بررسی لایحه‌ی بودجه آنها را به میان آورم. هنگامی که نماینده‌ای دیگر را در حال بازگو کردن سخنانم در مجلس دیدم، شگفتزده شدم. سخنران بعدی من بودم. برخاستم تا به سوی تریبون بروم که رئیس مجلس پیشنهاد کفایت مذاکرات داد و جلسه پایان یافت. مرا به رُک‌گویی می‌شناختند. بیشتر نمایندگان به رویدادهای محلی می‌پرداختند. من همواره درباره‌ی اولویت‌های ملی سخن می‌گفتم. در رابطه با هر بودجه‌ای، هر پیشنهادی و هر رأی‌گیری سخنرانی می‌کردم. زمینه‌ها متفاوت ولی بُن‌مایه همیشه یکسان بود: دادگری. واژه‌ای که بسیار در شاهنامه آمده است. همه، آنچه را که شایسته‌ی آنند دریافت می‌کنند. باری در یک سخنرانی گفتم باخبر شده‌ام که دریاسالار، فرمانده نیروی دریایی از ناو جنگی برای وارد کردن اسباب و اثاثیه خانه‌اش از ایتالیا استفاده کرده است. پرسیدم چگونه می‌توانیم چنین فسادی را برتابیم، و آن هم از مردی با سینه‌ای پر از نشان‌های افتخار. همه ساکت بودند. انتقاد از نیروهای نظامی امری کاملاً ناشناخته بود، زیرا آنها  برگزیده‌ی شاه بودند. من می‌خواستم نشان دهم که از بیان راستی‌ها بیمی نباید داشت. شاید دیگران نیز چنین کنند. آن فرمانده برکنار شد. کشور را نیکخواهی مردمانش پیش می‌برد و نیازمند مسئولیت‌پذیری دلیرانه است. سخنان من هرگز در رسانه‌ها بازتاب داده نمی‌شد. اگر هم در روزنامه اشاره‌ای به آن می‌شد، تنها گفته می‌شد: نماینده‌ی نهاوند سخنرانی کرد. ولی من کار خود را می‌کردم. همیشه امیدوار بودم که راهی برای شنیده شدن پیدا کنم. پندواژه‌ا‌ی درباره‌ی «سخنانی که پرواز می‌کنند» وجود دارد که می‌گوید اگر سخنان دروغ باشند، اگر خودخواهانه باشند، اگر آزمندانه باشند، هرگز پرواز نخواهند کرد، حتا اگر از بلندگوها فریاد زده شوند. حتا اگر همه در یک آن آنها را بیان کنند، بزودی فراموش می‌شوند زیرا جان ندارند. ولی اگر کسی واژه‌های مناسبی پیدا کند، سخنانی آهنگین، خردمندانه و راستین، بال خواهند گشود و پرواز خواهند کرد. حتا اگر از شنیده شدن‌شان جلوگیری شود، پرواز می‌کنند. حتا اگر گویندگان‌شان را خاموش کنند، پرواز می‌کنند. حتا اگر در ژرفای زمین فرو برند، همچنان پرواز می‌کنند و به در هر خانه‌ای می‌رسند",

  "text": "\"In 2001 I was a cocky, full-of-himself 18-year-old, driving in the East End with my 9-months-pregnant girlfriend Michelle, when our car was in a terrible crash and she and our unborn baby died. Witness statements said our car had been moving sideways as the bus came round the bend and hit us, and that I was found slumped over her, as if trying to protect her. But I have absolutely no memory of the crash, or much of the year before, so I still don't know if it was my fault. That's what haunts me to this day. The amazing paramedics, doctors, surgeons, nurses and therapists fixed me up like the Tin Man, screwing bits of me back together. But the most serious damage was to my brain. That caused paralysis all down my lefthand side, along with memory loss and a whole load of other malfunctions. When I was finally able to understand written words again, I read my hospital notes about the extent of my injuries, this young man who was about to die. My neurosurgeon said that, even with his miraculous invasive intervention, I probably would have died if I'd been older. I had to learn to walk, talk, read, write and think all over again, by forging new neural pathways in the undamaged parts of my brain. It felt as if my consciousness had teleported into a different, broken body in another time. \n\n\"Then I was charged with 'Causing death by dangerous driving'. Suddenly I was standing in the grandiose Old Bailey, facing a mandatory 14 years in prison. Michelle's gracious mother and father had mercy on me, saying they could see how I'd suffered already, and that no justice would be gained by my languishing in prison for an accident. So the charge was reduced to 'Careless driving' and that's what I pled guilty to. For years I've tortured myself trying to work out what happened. Was I to blame? Could I have done something to avoid it? I just don't know and I probably never will. But the weight of responsibility is enormous. My survivor's guilt was exacerbated by fearing I might be to blame for their deaths, and I was literally crippled by doubt. It just permeated my whole being and killed off my confidence and sense of worth.\" \n\nLee, photographed by Amar in Soho (1/2)",

  "text": "(3/3) \"I invited Dad over for Christmas but he thought I was going to get him a job because I was established in London. He wouldn’t leave and even stalked my new partner, which was very stressful. He was being super-difficult and we were rowing almost every evening. Eventually I said to him ‘This is too much!' The women I've met in London know that it's OK to look after themselves, that if they do they can look after and love others better too. My husband kept telling me that I had a right to protect myself, and I’ve now learnt that I, my child and my partner should be equally weighted when it comes to caring. I so wish my mother had realised that. If she had, she might still be here. There were many times I’d ask her to play with me but she said she couldn't because she had to clean the house. She didn’t know that she was allowed to be happy and enjoy her life and her kid. I've managed to break away from that sacrificial norm, and I'm careful to make time to sit, play and have fun with my daughter. The housework can wait. \n\n\"After my mother died I think I sanctified her in my head and felt that searching for my biological parents would disrespect her memory. Hearing from my dad that my biological mother asked for 5000 Lei (around £440) when I was adopted didn't make me any keener to find her. But a couple of years ago my dad and I had a heart-to-heart and when he actually said 'Sorry' things changed. We talk more now, and when I nervously invited him over for Christmas again he totally behaved. We've also bought the house in the mountains where my father was born. My great aunt had owned it and our whole family used it as a holiday home. It's such a special place - so beautiful and reclusive. It’s a bit of heaven. My dad was happy there and now he can go there anytime he wants which he just loves. He also likes to feel he's contributing by overseeing the renovation work. It’s been a healing thing, and we've built on that and stepped into a new stage of our relationship.\"\n\nAndreea, photographed by Amar in Soho and phone-HoGLed by Beth (3/3)  \n\n#happyinternationalwomensday",

  "text": "(2/3) \"My dad didn’t cope well with losing her. We had a few lovely months where we became a team, a little unit, and he taught me to cook, let me help him fix the car, and hugged me more often. Then I realised he was drinking too much. Worse still, less than a year after my mum had died he brought his new partner, my wicked stepmother, into my life and she made me call her 'Mum'. He'd actually started an affair with her before my mum died, and he was so blinded by her that he forgot about everything else, including me. He didn't look after my school needs, or give me pocket-money or any real attention. Then he married her and she tried to get him to 'return' me, to write me out of their lives in favour of her 2 sons. \n\n\"My whole family was enraged, and my mum's sister took me to stay with her and looked after me. The marriage lasted 2 years before they had a massive row and broke up. After that he began coming to school every day  asking me to come home, and I thought, as his only kid, I should give him another chance. Maybe I could help him? But I was in my last year at school with some serious exams coming up, and I found I just couldn't forgive him for what I saw as a massive betrayal, of both me and my mum. After he went to Italy for work to put me through university we had a distant but alright relationship. Then I fell pregnant and he was so delighted. He absolutely adores my daughter. I think he saw her as a second chance at being a father. But my relationship with my daughter's dad wasn't working and I could see my unhappiness was making her unhappy too. So I decided to remove her from that negative environment, divorced him and came with her to London to dedicate myself to what I had wanted for a long time - acting and producing. It was the best decision. I’ve only had positive experiences. I didn’t ever think I’d have a second marriage, and I told myself that even if it was just me and my daughter, we'd be fine. Then I met my now-husband who is smart and funny, cares for the Earth, and loves us.\"\n\nAndreea, photographed by Amar in Soho and phone-HoGLed by Beth (2/3)  \n\n#happyinternationalwomensday",

  "text": "(23/54) “Each night when I came home from parliament I’d find Mitra ready to go out. And no matter how tired I felt, off we would go. She always looked perfect. She stayed current with all the latest trends. Every few months she’d have her hair cut in the style of a different American actress. I loved having her by my side in social situations. I was horrible at parties. I could never think of the right thing to say. If I tried to make a joke, people would tickle themselves to laugh. But not Mitra. She was spontaneous, she was funny. Words came from her like light from a lamp. And she could speak to anyone. There were never any formalities. No warm-up. She’d talk to every person as if she’d known them her entire life. We’d go to gatherings with ten or fifteen of our friends; often Dr. Ameli would be there. As soon as Mitra walked in the room the silence would end. At some point in the evening the conversation would always turn to politics. And the moment I began to debate an issue, Mitra would take the other side. She would team up with anyone against me. The person never mattered. The topic never mattered. She never wanted to get me started, so she’d always shut me down. It’s how we’ve been our entire lives. I’ve been the gas, she’s been the brakes. I thought about her every time I wrote a speech. She’s always been my antithesis. The hardest for me to convince. It could sometimes seem like her main purpose in life was to oppose me. To the outside world our love made no sense. We seemed so far apart. But there are many types of closeness. And some the world will never see. We still read poetry together. Mitra still trusted me to find the melody. There was one poem called ‘Sin,’ by Forough Farrokhzad. It scandalized religious society; everyone was talking about it. But it was one of Mitra’s favorites, so I’d memorized the entire thing: 𝘐 𝘴𝘪𝘯𝘯𝘦𝘥 𝘢 𝘴𝘪𝘯 𝘧𝘶𝘭𝘭 𝘰𝘧 𝘱𝘭𝘦𝘢𝘴𝘶𝘳𝘦 / 𝘪𝘯 𝘢𝘯 𝘦𝘮𝘣𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘸𝘢𝘴 𝘸𝘢𝘳𝘮 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘦𝘢𝘨𝘦𝘳 / 𝘐 𝘴𝘪𝘯𝘯𝘦𝘥 𝘸𝘳𝘢𝘱𝘱𝘦𝘥 𝘪𝘯 𝘢𝘳𝘮𝘴 / 𝘩𝘰𝘵, 𝘩𝘢𝘳𝘥, 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘢𝘷𝘦𝘯𝘨𝘪𝘯𝘨 / 𝘪𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘥𝘢𝘳𝘬 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘴𝘪𝘭𝘦𝘯𝘵 𝘴𝘦𝘤𝘭𝘶𝘴𝘪𝘰𝘯 / 𝘐 𝘬𝘯𝘦𝘸 𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘴𝘦𝘤𝘳𝘦𝘵𝘴 / 𝘮𝘺 𝘩𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘵 𝘲𝘶𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘦𝘥 𝘪𝘯 𝘮𝘺 𝘣𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘴𝘵 / 𝘪𝘯 𝘢𝘯𝘴𝘸𝘦𝘳 𝘵𝘰 𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘩𝘶𝘯𝘨𝘳𝘺 𝘦𝘺𝘦𝘴.”\n\nهر شب که از مجلس به خانه برمی‌گشتم، میترا را می‌دیدم که آماده‌ی بیرون رفتن بود، با همه‌ی خستگی‌ها باید می‌رفتم. بودنش در کنار من همیشه دلپذیر بود. خوش‌لباس بود. بریده‌های مجله را نزد خیاطش می‌برد و مو به مو آنچه را می‌خواست به او می‌گفت. موهایش همواره آراسته بود. هر چند ماه یکبار، موهایش را به سبک بازیگری آمریکایی به مدل‌های گوناگون کوتاه می‌کرد. در مهمانی‌ها آرامش نداشتم. هرگز نمی‌توانستم سخنان مناسبی برای گفت‌وگوی معمولی بیابم. هر بار تلاش می‌کردم شوخی کنم، مردم به زور می‌خندیدند. ولی میترا نه. واژگان به راحتی از دهانش بیرون می‌آمدند مانند نور از چراغ. او خودجوش بود، شوخ بود. می‌توانست با هر کس سخن بگوید. هیچ رودربایستی نداشت. نیازی به آمادگی نداشت. با هر کس چنان سخن می‌گفت که گویی همه‌ی عمر او را می‌شناخته است. با ده، پانزده تن از دوستان‌مان دوره داشتیم؛ در پاره‌ای از مهمانی‌ها دکتر عاملی هم می‌آمد. همین که میترا به اتاق وارد می‌شد، خاموشی پایان می‌یافت. زمانی می‌رسید که گفت‌وگوها به سیاست می‌گرایید. درست زمانی که من وارد بحثی می‌شدم، میترا بی‌درنگ جانب شخص مقابل را می‌گرفت. او در برابر من با هر کس متحد می‌شد. مهم نبود چه کسی‌ست. مهم نبود زمینه‌ی گفت‌وگو چیست. او تنها می‌خواست مرا ساکت کند. من چون پِدال گاز بودم و او چون ترمز. هر گاه متن یک سخنرانی را می‌نوشتم، به میترا فکر می‌کردم. او همواره نقطه‌ی مقابل من بوده است. سرسخت‌ترین شخصی که می‌بایستی متقاعد می‌کردم او بود. گاه به نظر می‌رسید که هدف بزرگ او در زندگی مخالفت با من بوده است. از دیدگاه دنیای بیرونی، عشق ما منطقی نمی‌نمود. بسیار دور از هم به نظر می‌رسیدیم. ولی گونه‌های بسیار از نزدیکی وجود دارند و برخی را دنیا هرگز نتواند دید. ما همچنان با هم شعر می‌خوانیم. میترا هنوز باور دارد که من آهنگ شعر را به درستی درمی‌یابم. شعری‌ست از سروده‌های فروغ فرخزاد به نام «گناه». این شعر جامعه‌ی مذهبی را به چالش می‌کشید؛ همه درباره‌ی آن سخن می‌گفتند. میترا این شعر را چندان دوست داشت که آنرا از بر کرده بودم: گنه کردم گناهی پر ز لذت   /   در آغوشی که گرم و آتشین بود   /   گنه کردم میان بازوانی   /   که داغ و کینه‌جوی و آهنین بود   /   در آن خلوتگه تاریک و خاموش   /   نگه کردم به چشم پر ز رازش   /   دلم در سینه بی‌تابانه لرزید   /   زخواهش‌های چشم پر نیازش",

  "text": "(22/54) “Dr. Ameli was elected to parliament in the same election, and was chosen by his peers for a leadership position. He was a unifying figure. A man without enemies. His words never cut. He attacked philosophies; never people. And he was one of the best speakers in parliament. He didn’t use slogans. He spoke with depth. And somehow, no matter how specific the policy, or how divisive the issue, he always came back to a place of unity. Our common destiny as a people. On the morning our first budget was presented Dr. Ameli approached me in the halls of parliament. He asked if I planned to give a speech. I told him I did not, because I had no specific objections. He leaned close to my ear, and with a soft voice he said: ‘Still, you must speak. To separate yourself from the system.’ That night I slept on a rug on the floor of parliament, and first thing in the morning I placed myself on the calendar of speakers. When my turn came I walked down the aisle toward the podium. My knees felt weak. There is a magnitude to speaking in parliament, a consciousness of history. I’ve never been a natural speaker. I’m never the one chosen to give a toast at parties. But if I believe a statement is true, I can say it. No matter how big the stage. Truth has power. Truth has a force. 𝘕𝘪𝘳𝘰𝘰.  It doesn’t come from the tongue, it comes from within. And the moment I take my place at the podium: it’s like a spring has been sprung.  That day I spoke about justice. 𝘋𝘢𝘢𝘥. I said that justice in society begins with justice in our budget. There was a proposal in the budget to build a new telephone system in one of Tehran’s nicest neighborhoods. I reminded the parliament that there were entire villages without a single phone. I said: ‘Before we give the wealthy a phone by every bedside, let us give a phone to every village.’ It was one of the most forceful speeches I’ve ever given. But there was no mention in the media; criticism of the government was not allowed. I at least wanted a copy for my own records. There was a person in parliament who transcribed everything, so I asked them for a copy of my speech. But they told me it was not allowed. They would not even give me my own words.” \n\nدکتر عاملی هم در انتخابات مجلس پیروز شده بود و افزون بر آن به ریاست کمیسیون آموزش و پرورش هم. از بهترین سخنرانان بود. هنگام سخنرانی هرگز فریاد نمی‌کشید. واژگانش آزاردهنده و خشن نبودند. او به فلسفه‌ها می‌پرداخت نه به آدمها. سخنانش ژرفای ویژه‌ داشتند. هرگز شعارگونه سخن نمی‌گفت. سراپای سخنانش به هم پیوسته بود. هر اندازه موضوع پیچیده بود، هر اندازه طرح و برنامه ویژه بود، همیشه آنرا به سرنوشت ایران و ایرانیان گره می‌زد، سرنوشت‌مان به عنوان یک ملت. در نخستین بامدادی که بودجه‌ی دولت ارائه شده بود، دکتر عاملی در راهروی مجلس به من نزدیک شد. پرسید که آیا قصد دارم در مورد بودجه سخنرانی کنم. به او گفتم که تمایل ویژه‌ای ندارم . نزدیکتر آمد و به آرامی گفت: «همیشه باید سخن گفت، ما سخنان خود را می‌گوییم.» نخستین کاری که کردم نوشتن نامم در فهرست سخنرانان بود. آن شب را روی فرشی بر زمین مجلس بیتوته کردم. وهنگامی که نوبت من شد پشت سکوی سخنرانی رفتم. سخنرانی‌های بسیاری پیش از این انجام داده بودم ولی سخنرانی در مجلس متفاوت بود. از اهمیت و شکوه خاصی برخوردار است. همراه با نوعی خودآگاهی تاریخی. من هیچگاه سخنرانی طبیعی نبودم. نمی‌توانم به شیوایی درباره‌ی موضوع‌های گوناگون صحبت کنم. هیچگاه در مهمانی‌ها مرا برای خوش‌آمدگویی انتخاب نمی‌کردند. ولی هرگاه به درستی گفتاری باور داشته باشم، آنرا به زبان می‌آورم. نیرویی هست که با گفتن حقیقت همراه است. از زبان نه که از دل برمی‌آید. هنگامی که پشت سکوی سخنرانی قرار بگیرم، مانند فنری رها می‌شوم. آن روز درباره‌ی عدالت و دادگری سخن گفتم. همانگونه که به دادگری در قانون، در بودجه هم نیازمندیم. به طرحی اشاره کردم که برای کشیدن سامانه‌ی تلفنی تازه‌ای برای یکی از مرفه‌ترین منطقه‌ها‌ی تهران بود. به مجلس یادآوری کردم، روستاهایی داریم که حتا یک تلفن هم ندارند. گفتم: «پیش از آنکه خط تلفن را به اتاق خواب‌های ثروتمندان شهرها بکشیم، بیایید نخست تلفن عمومی را به همه‌ جای کشور برسانیم.» سخنانم در هیچ جا بازتابی نیافت؛ هیچ انتقادی اجازه‌ی پخش در رسانه‌ها را نداشت. از منشی مجلس نسخه‌ای از آنچه را گفته بودم درخواست کردم تا سندی از آن داشته باشم. به من گفتند که اجازه‌ی چنین کاری را ندارند. سخنان خودم را هم به من ندادند",

  "text": "(21/54) “After the election I took one more visit to Ferdowsi’s tomb. This time I brought my own children with me. It hadn’t changed much in thirty years, but I had changed. I had a better understanding of the sacrifice he’d made for his ideals. Ferdowsi worked for thirty-three years. Seven verses a day. 𝘈 𝘤𝘢𝘴𝘵𝘭𝘦 𝘰𝘧 𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘥𝘴, 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘯𝘰 𝘸𝘪𝘯𝘥 𝘰𝘳 𝘳𝘢𝘪𝘯 𝘸𝘪𝘭𝘭 𝘥𝘦𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘰𝘺. While my children played in the gardens I stood quietly at the foot of his tomb. I ran my fingers across the stones. ‘In The Name of The God of Soul and Wisdom.’ 𝘑𝘢𝘢𝘯 and 𝘒𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘥. The two things all humans have. The wisdom to choose. And the soul to create. When I received the development budget for Nahavand, I called a meeting in the town’s biggest auditorium. Each village sent a representative. I told them: ‘God created the earth, the trees, and the waters—but after that he did not make a single chair. He has left the rest to us.’ I told them: ‘Organize a council, assess your own needs, make specific proposals.’ I’d only pay for things that could be seen, because I wanted no corruption in Nahavand. And priority was given to projects where labor was provided by the villagers themselves. I wanted them to get involved, participate. I wanted them to feel a sense of ownership. I wanted an Iran where everyone felt like the king or queen of their own country. Back then it was common for villagers to kiss the hands of government officials. I would not allow it. I told them: ‘We don’t need to do this anymore.’ If I was unable to stop them in time, I’d kiss their hand right back. There was one woman in Nahavand who lived in a tent. I promised her that I would not own a home before she did. I tended Nahavand like I tended my garden. I picked every weed the moment it appeared.  I followed up on every call, every letter. My phone was never unplugged. My plan was to serve two or three terms, so that I could gain some experience and build my name. Then I’d bring my ideas directly to the people. What I could do for my garden, I could do for Nahavand. And what I could do for Nahavand, I could do for all of Iran.” \n\nپس از انتخابات، سفری دیگر به آرامگاه فردوسی رفتم. بچه‌ها همراهم بودند. در حالی که آنها در باغ‌ و میان درختان سرگرم بازی بودند، خاموش پای آرامگاه ایستادم، انگشتانم را به نرمی بر سنگ‌ آرامگاه کشیدم. بیش از هزار سال است که پیکر پاکش درون این خاک گرامی خفته است. «به نام خداوند جان و خرد.» دو پدیده که همه‌ی مردمان از آن برخوردارند. خرد برای گزینش و جان برای کوشش و آفرینش. فردوسی سی‌وسه سال کار کرد. میانگین روزانه‌اش هفت بیت است. کاخی از نظم پی افکند که از باد و باران نیابد گزند. آرامگاه در این چهل سال تغییر چندانی نکرده بود. من ولی تغییر کرده بودم. آگاهی و شناخت بیشتری از فداکاری‌های او برای آرمان‌هایش داشتم. در آغاز دوره‌ی نمایندگی‌ام، بودجه‌ی اندکی در اختیار نمایندگان گذاشتند تا خرج آبادانی روستاها شود. به جای قسمت کردن آن به طور مساوی میان روستاها، جلسه‌ای در سالن بزرگ شهر برگزار کردم، به نمایندگان روستاها گفتم که انجمن‌هایشان را  تشکیل دهند. نیازمندی‌های خود را ارزیابی کنند و پیشنهادهای دقیق ارائه دهند. گفتم: «خدا زمین، درختان و آب‌ را آفرید ولی پس از آن یک صندلی هم نساخته است. کارهای دیگر با ماست.» می‌خواستم مسئولیت آنان را نسبت به خود و جامعه یادآور شوم، چشم به راه کسی نباشند تا دشواری‌هایشان را آسان کند. ایرانی می‌خواستم که همه در آن مشارکت داشته باشند. ایرانی که در آن زن و مرد ایرانی شهریاران میهن‌اند. از دیرباز در روستاها بوسیدن دست بزرگان‌شان رسم بود‌ ولی من هرگز این را نپذیرفتم. گفتم: «نیازی به این کار نیست.» و اگر ناگهانی پیش می آمد من هم بی‌درنگ دست آنها را می‌بوسیدم. در نهاوند زنی تنها کنار شهر در چادر می‌زیست. از من درخواست خانه داشت، به او گفتم تا زمانی که او خانه‌دار نشود من هم خانه‌دار نخواهم شد، کاش دستکم او تا کنون صاحب خانه‌اش شده باشد! به نمایندگان قطعه زمینی با بهای ارزان پیشنهاد شد، من نپذیرفتم. از نهاوند مانند باغچه‌ی خودم پرستاری می‌کردم. همینکه گیاه هرزه‌ای نمایان می‌شد آنرا از ریشه می‌کندم. تلفن من هرگز بسته نبود. همه‌ی تلفن‌ها و نامه‌ها را پی‌گیر بودم. اگر در توانم بود یاری کنم، می‌کردم. برنامه‌ام این بود که دو یا سه دوره خدمت کنم تا مرا به درستی بشناسند، پس می‌توانستم به یاری آرمانخواهان دیگر راه پیشرفت و سرفرازی‌ها را بپیماییم. آنچه را برای باغچه‌ام می‌توانستم بکنم، برای نهاوند هم خواهم توانست و آنچه را که برای نهاوند بتوانم، برای ایران هم شدنی‌ست",

  "text": "\"I was rescued from a Romanian orphanage, which was a horrible place where many of us were malnourished and mistreated. Although I was 3, I still hadn't learnt to walk when my adoptive mother came to visit. After a long struggle to conceive she and her husband had bravely decided to adopt, despite the stigma attached to it at the time. She said she felt like I chose her because I was the only child there who was looking at her, and she also liked how I looked like my adoptive dad. They both used to say that they managed to put me right with love. I grew up surrounded by it, and everyone in my big extended family, uncles and aunts, grandparents, made me feel I belonged. \n\n\"They'd been planning to tell me I was adopted when I turned 14, but they had to do it earlier, when I was 10, after a bully at school kept telling me I wasn't my parent's child. Because my paternal grandfather was always telling me stories about little girls who turned out to be me, my parents told me this story about a little girl who was very much loved but had a very difficult start in life as an orphan. I cried for her before I discovered that she was me. But even though it had made me wonder who I was, I was scared to try and find out any more about the people who had given me up. After all, I was happy with my family and I already had a wonderful mum and dad. Then, when I was 14, my mum died, in my dad's arms, from Type 1 Diabetes. It isn’t necessarily something that will kill you. You can live with it if you look after yourself and eat well. But in Romania, as a woman, you’re supposed to look after your family and loved ones first or you're seen as selfish. So she neglected herself. I remember my dad telling her off for not eating the food her doctor recommended. I was a typical self-involved teenager and didn’t realise she was so ill. When I was little, she’d faint maybe once or twice a year, but by the end it was happening a lot. I recently saw a picture of her taken 2 months before she passed away and she looked so thin. I can’t believe I didn’t see it at the time.\" \n\nAndreea, photographed by Amar in Soho and phone-HoGLed by Beth (1/3)",

  "text": "\"I never thought I’d have a family. I was so used to the idea of a traditional family that when, at the age of 18, I first fell in love with a man, I thought that that was it. No children. I did really want to have them because I’d had such a happy childhood myself, growing up in the 50s, in a family of 5, on an airforce base in New Zealand. I would recreate films in our garden by dressing up as Lana Turner or doing westerns wearing my Davy Crockett hat. My parents never made me feel shame or guilt for any of this, although they never actually used the word gay. Then I followed my heart, and the man I’d fallen in love with, to London. Years later, when our relationship ended, the confusion and heartache drew me and a friend together in a new way. She was a divorcee, also damaged by loss, and our relationship developed from friendship to love and led to the birth of my first child. We married, moved away from London where we had my second child, and I became father to an extended family of stepchildren too.\n\n\"Life did feel complete, but when the marriage ended I was left feeling unfulfilled. So I moved back to London and enrolled in a photography course, then an arts management course, which led to curating an arts gallery - something I still do and absolutely love. I had some hedonistic times, I call them my ‘wilderness years’, but I still yearned for a soulmate. Then, 8 years ago, I met him and he’s the love of my life. It’s almost as if we were fated to meet, our paths nearly crossed so many times before, and we’re so in tune. We’ve embraced everything about each other and also now share a large, fantastic family complete with grandchildren. If I could talk to my younger, sensitive, vulnerable self I’d say ‘Don’t worry so much. Wonderful things will happen to you that are right out of your control!’ I’m so glad I moved here. London fulfils dreams and desires. It’s given me everything I ever wanted, and it’s made me the happy man I’m now proud to be.”\n\nPeter, met at the Colour Me Ecstatic festival in St Pancras.\n\nThrowback to March 2019.",

  "text": "\"I went to Art College instead of trying A Levels as I'd failed all my GCSEs. They made me feel worth something and taught me how to learn by playing. One time they gave us a whole load of bread and said 'Make a sculpture out of that - toasted, mushed-with-water, whatever'. That taught me an iterative learning process where you make a safe space and keep trying different things, over and over again. I found that removing any end goal and just focussing on playing stopped my dyslexia from showing it's ugly head. It's how I've learnt pretty much everything I'm good at since, including my portrait photography which I  started doing as a fun way of connecting with people. I then got into Uni to do a Computer Animation Arts BA, where I had an powerful computer for my coursework which my dad kindly bought for me. Now I make computer-generated creatures for the film and commercials VFX industry as a Senior Character Technical Director.\n\n\"Everything feels like it's fallen into place. I love my job. I earn well and have a comfortable house. My dad and I have a much better relationship. My sister's so happy with her amazing husband and 2 wonderful kids, in a way I couldn't even imagine her being while we were growing up. And I have a wonderful partner, Carrie. Being with her 24/7 through the lockdowns has really deepened our intimacy, and that's fast-forwarded things and got us thinking long term. She's American and has travelled more widely than anybody I know, which has made her wonderfully worldly, inclusive and liberal. She's such a smart cookie, someone I genuinely look up to and admire, and also a deeply empathetic, warm person. Dad's parents are embracing her more now, partly because they can see my happiness, but also I think because the people older than them who were dictating traditions have all died. So they're on their own and having to learn to be more open and flexible. They've started to appreciate my mum's huge heart too. There's a positive change happening, but obviously it's slow because they're old and have difficulty learning new things.\" \n\nAmar, photographed by Emma Taylor-Gilli in St James's Park (2/2)\n\nSee also the comments below...",

  "text": "\"My sister and I had a tough time growing up. I had dyslexia quite badly as a child, as well as asthma, attention difficulties and short term memory issues. My school just kept giving me bad reports, failing me on everything and making me feel stupid. And my dad's family (who we lived with) are deeply conservative Indians, very tough and insular and proud, who couldn't understand why I wouldn't learn. I couldn't even spell my name, so they kept making me try, and every time I got it wrong they'd hit me, or threaten to kick me out of the house. I was a first-born son, so they were showing an interest in me which I was grateful for. But I also felt guilty that I was getting so much more attention than my sister. I'm not saying they're bad people. They just had very traditional ideas about what good parenting was, and too much influence over my dad too. Mum's side are much more liberal, careful and kind, and she's got this immense warmth and empathy. So they and my sister were my safe zone. \n\n\"Then, when I was 10, my parents had a nasty divorce. It was an arranged marriage but they were too different and married too young. While my dad was on holiday in India his parents actually threw Mum out of the house, and of course we went with her. We couch-surfed for about 3 months before we were housed again, and we were really poor for many years. A year before the divorce I'd also developed a blood condition similar to Haemophilia where you don't heal. Even sitting with my legs crossed would bruise my knees, and I once had a 4-day-long nosebleed. That did make my dad's family back off and be less aggressive, but Mum was amazing. She let me do what I wanted with my mind and just helped me sort out my body. She drove us through the NHS process, despite lots of fobbing off, and at 14 I was finally referred to a specialist and diagnosed. They removed my spleen, and I'm on penicillin now, twice a day for the rest of my life. I have less of an immunity (which is why I've been shielding and just had my first Covid jab), but that's better than not being able to heal.\" \n\nAmar, photographed by Emma Taylor-Gilli in St James's Park (1/2)",

She'd actually threatened to do that on one of our first dates and meant it as a joke, but when she saw the anxious expression on my face she quickly changed that to  'Yes!' We loved telling people 'We're engaged!' as it felt like a public celebration of our relationship. In October 2018 we got married in Berlin (where we live now) with our parents and siblings travelling from Germany, Bulgaria, Holland and Switzerland. We'd planned various activities for the weekend, including a visit to the Berlin Botanical Gardens as that's one of our happy places, so there was a lot to organise, and it was the first time our families had all met each other too. But, looking back, it was wonderful. Perfect. We've recently celebrated our 8-year-anniversary of being together, and we can proudly say we're the happiest we've ever been. I could never go back to a long distance relationship again. I can't get enough of Lily.\"\n\nL: \"We seem to not be able to get enough of each other. Spending the first Lockdown together in a tiny flat was the ultimate test. It's never boring and we continue to enjoy each other and have fun together. We've also become more aware and accepting of our differences, and adapted our habits to accommodate each other's needs. For example, John wakes up earlier than me, and every day he makes me a cup of coffee while I'm still asleep, even though he doesn't drink coffee. We're also taking care of our mental health, and making more effort to slow down and smell the roses. And we still really value the power of small rituals and gestures.\"\n\nJ: \"Every evening before dinner we do this little exercise where we tell each other what we're grateful for. This is so meaningful and once it's become a habit it's really easy to do. We know that good relationships and developing together takes time, focus and effort.\"  \n\nL: \"We do work a lot on our communication and awareness, and we're always recognizing and celebrating how the other one makes our life better. Now we're stronger together than I ever dreamt we'd be, and although the future's uncertain I'm so glad to be facing it with him.\"\n\nJohn and Lily, remote-HoGLed recently in Berlin for an update on their 2015 story (see previous post), and photographed here at their wedding by Jennifer Block (click on the 2nd pic below for part 2).",

We've also been doing the #100HappyDays thing for 2 years now, so every day we'll send each other something that has made us happy.

  "text": "\"I'm an empath, so I've always felt other people's pain as sharply as my own. I also seem to have attracted a lot of damaged people into my life, then spent too much time and energy trying to fix them instead of taking care of myself. I've suffered from depression, on and off, ever since my first son was born, and since the Lockdowns started I've been getting these awful panic attacks too. The other day I went to Iceland to do some food shopping and I could feel one starting and just burst into tears. It was so embarrassing. I could see all these people looking at me and I just had to leave, without any of the shopping I needed to get. I've been to some very dark places. I imagine everyone has, and I know we're all struggling, but it's been really hard. \n\n\"I have 4 great kids - 2 boys who are 18 and 16 now, and 2 girls who are 11 and 7 - but I'm bringing them up on my own. I got together with the boys' dad when I was 19 and he turned out to be an alcoholic, so we separated when the boys were 5 and 3, and he's hardly ever around now. I met him in a pub where I was singing karaoke. I've always loved singing, it's my favourite thing to do, and luckily people tell me I'm quite good at it. But I only began singing professionally a couple of years ago, and of course now all the pubs and clubs are closed so I can't do that any more. I'm doing my best to support us by working shifts at Subway instead. I met the girls' dad online and my anxiety started soon after we married because he turned out to be a horrible man who used to abuse me all the time, mentally and emotionally more than physically. We're still married but only because he wants to retain some control over me. We hardly ever see him either. So it's hard for my kids and I feel so guilty that I've put them in this situation where I'm all they've got. I beat myself up all the time and tell myself I'm a terrible mum, but I'm getting some therapy, taking it one step at a time, and doing the best I can. I know they'd still rather have me than not have me. So they are my strength. They're what keeps me going, because I can't bear to think of them being all alone.\"   \n\nJessica, photographed at a #FriendsFest in 2019.",

At one point I really thought I'd be coming home alone. But a local army doctor saved his life, and after we got home and I'd also stopped eating gluten and soy, my Auto-Immune Disease was cured too. He's definitely the right man for me. He's so patient and wise, with such a big heart.

  "text": "\"When this picture was taken in 2017 I was almost 19. My dad had been diagnosed with lung cancer 2 months before and he died 2 months after. I'd started working and saving when I was 15 and moved out when I was 17. But in those last 4 months we found a mutually-respectful adult relationship which was really, really nice. He was only 54, but he'd been smoking since he was 16 and had a lot of other health issues too. In his 20s, while exploring a mountain in Indonesia, the photographer leading them fell to his death, and my dad also fell and broke both his ankles and his collarbone. So he used a walking stick, had arthritis, and suffered a lot of pain. After my sister was born he became a house-husband and looked after us while my mother's social work supported the family. That did occasionally make him bitter, but he was a very well-travelled, well-rounded man, who always had interesting things to say. He did a degree in Geography, so he loved being outdoors, cared deeply about the environment, and made sure that we lived in a very sustainable way. He was also a massive fan of world music, culture and cooking. He'd take us to WOMAD Festival every year. And he just loved getting in the car, turning the music up loud, and driving us off on road trips to pitch a tent somewhere. \n\n\"But he was also quite strict. We didn't have a television until I was maybe 14, and  we didn't have our own phones either. I remember feeling very upset and resentful about that because it made me the odd one out at school. But looking back I wouldn't change it because I learned to love being outdoors, how to play the drums, and enjoy being in real social situations instead. It made me so present growing up, unlike too many young people today who seem to be so addicted to their phones and Social Media it's heartbreaking. But I think the pandemic has given us all a lot more time to stop and think. About how we need to live in more healthy, hygienic and sustainable ways. About the damage we're doing to ourselves and the environment. I think it's created more awareness and shown us how quickly things can change too.\"\n\nAtma, photographed beside St. Paul's Cathedral by Christopher Andreou.",

  "text": "(20/54) “Dr. Ameli helped me open a party office. He was an established man by then. But he took the time to come to Nahavand, and I’ll never forget the speech that he gave. He said: ‘Now it is winter, the rivers are frozen, the trees are all dead. But soon green sprouts will burst from the soil. The air will fill with the songs of nightingales. And together we will say: 'Spring has arrived.'” There were over one hundred villages in Nahavand, and I made the decision to visit every single one. My father loaned me his jeep, and I would spend all day on the road. Most villages had a central square, and that is where I would speak. I was a practicing Muslim; I knew the Koran front-to-back. But I never spoke about religion. I spoke about what needed to be done: better roads, better schools, fresh water. I spoke about justice. Daad. About an Iran where every person got their fair share. And I spoke about freedom. Azadi. I told them: ‘The king should not choose your candidates. All of Iran should be your candidates.’ In the first few villages only a handful of people came to my speeches. It was not customary for candidates to speak directly to the voters. My two opponents stayed in their homes and held fancy parties with their friends. But as I continued to speak, word began to spread. More people came, and then those people would go tell others. I’d always give my speeches around 6 pm. Some of the stores began to close early, so that the shopkeepers could attend. At first it was just a few. But by the end of my campaign, every single shop would close. The moment my jeep pulled into town, it would be met by cheering crowds. Hundreds of people would gather around to hear me. People as far as the eye could see. On the day of the vote I took the jeep for one final trip around Nahavand. I remember seeing young women, with babies on their breast, going to cast their vote. Later that night the results were announced on television. Early in the day people began to gather around my father’s house. When the vote was announced, the crowd erupted into cheers. Each of my opponents had gotten two thousand votes. I received over twenty thousand.” \n\nدکتر عاملی برای گشایش دفتر حزب به نهاوند آمد. او بزرگمردی ستودنی بود. سخنرانی او را فراموش نکرده‌ام.‌ گفت: «اکنون زمستان است، آب‌ها یخ بسته‌اند، درختان مرده‌اند. پرندگان رفته‌اند، برگ و باری و نغمه و آهنگی نیست ولی به زودی جوانه‌های سبز درفش‌هایشان را از دل خاک برخواهند افراشت. آوای بلبلان آسمان را پر خواهد کرد. و همه با هم خواهیم گفت: بهار آمد!» بر آن شدم تا با مردمانی از بیش از یک‌سد روستای نهاوند گفت‌وگو کنم. پدرم جیپش را در اختیارم نهاد و من روزها را در راه و روستا می‌گذراندم. درمیدان روستا با من آشنا می‌شدند و سخنانم را می‌شنیدند. با آنکه مسلمانی باورمند بودم هرگز درباره‌ی دین سخن نگفتم. سخن من تنها در زمینه‌ی کارهایی بود که باید انجام می‌گرفت: راه‌های بهتر، دبستان‌های بهتر، آب آشامیدنی پاکیزه و دیگر بایسته‌های ویژه‌ی هر روستا. درباره‌ی عدالت سخن می‌گفتم. درباره‌ی ایرانی که در آن همه به حق خود برسند و درباره‌ی آزادی. به آنها می‌گفتم: «دولت نباید نامزدهای شما را انتخاب کند. هر ایرانی باید بتواند خود را نامزد کند، رأی شماست که او را برمی‌گزیند!» در نخستین روزها تنها تنی چند برای شنیدن سخنانم می‌آمدند. گفت‌وگوی رو در رو با رأی‌دهندگان امری نا‌آشنا بود. رقیبانم در خانه‌های خود می‌ماندند و با دوستانشان مهمانی‌هایی برگزار می‌کردند. من به دیدار‌هایم ادامه دادم و خبر در میان مردم پخش می‌شد. هر روز که می گذشت، مردم بیشتری می‌آمدند و دیگران را باخبر می‌کردند. همیشه سخنرانی‌هایم را در میدان شهر حدود ساعت ۶ عصر برگزار می‌کردم. کاسبان فروشگاه‌ها‌یشان را زودتر می‌بستند تا بتوانند در سخنرانی‌هایم باشند. نخست شمارشان اندک بود ولی در روزهای پایانی کارزار انتخاباتی من، فروشگاه‌هایشان را زودتر می‌بستند. هنگامی که جیپ من وارد شهر می‌شد، جمعیتی هوراکشان به پیشباز  می‌آمدند. کسانی از راه های دورتر  می‌رسیدند تا سخنانم را بشنوند. تا جایی که چشمم کار می‌کرد مردم ایستاده بودند. در روز انتخابات با جیپ پدرم به چندین روستا سرکشیدم. به یاد دارم که زنان جوان با کودکی در آغوش به سوی صندوق های رأی در راهند. در واپسین ساعت‌های آن شب نتیجه‌ از تلویزیون پخش می‌شد. مردم کم کم پیرامون فرمانداری که به خانه‌ی پدرم هم نزدیک بود گرد می‌آمدند. هنگامی که نتیجه اعلام شد همه از شادی فریاد کشیدند. هر یک از رقیبان من دو هزار رأی آورده بودند. من بیش از بیست‌ هزار",

  "text": "(19/54) “It has always been my philosophy: wherever I am, I try to make the most of the responsibilities I am given. Managing a factory was not my ideal position. I had hoped to find a place where I could have more of a national impact. But I tried my best to improve the lives of the people nearest to me. I continued to hold meetings with the workers. I studied employment practices from all over the world, and drafted a policy of worker’s rights. It was very progressive for the time. But when I presented the document to the Department of Labor— it was approved for the entire factory. Five thousand lives were made better.  In 1975 the king made an announcement that he was dissolving all political parties and combining them into one. He claimed that it was an attempt at unity, but it was abhorrent to me. A country cannot be ruled by a single voice. In the next election I decided to return to Nahavand and run for parliament as my own man. Mitra was against it. She told me that I was too honest for politics, too naive. She said: ‘Even if you win. You’re a single voice. The rest of the parliament will still be controlled by the king.’ Even my father didn’t want me to run. He didn’t think I stood a chance, and he didn’t want to see me get my heart broken. The king had to approve all candidates, and he’d chosen two of his closest allies as my opponents. One of them played volleyball with the king and empress. The other was Undersecretary of Education for the entire country. He was so confident of his victory that he’d already resigned from his previous position. After I announced my candidacy, he paid me a visit. He told me: ‘I want you to know. Everyone in government is supporting me. And this position has been promised to me.’ I told him: ‘I’m very happy for you. I have no intention of winning. But I am going to say what I have to say.”\n\nفلسفه‌ی زندگی‌ام همواره بر آن بوده است که بیشترین تلاشم را در هر جایگاه و مسئولیتی که به من داده شود انجام دهم. کار من در کارخانه‌ی ذوب‌آهن اصفهان مدیریت بخش ارزیابی و آمار بود. پیشه‌ی دلخواهم نبود. مهندس مکانیک و کارشناس اقتصاد فنی ملی بودم. دوست داشتم برنامه‌ریزی کلان کشور  را یاری کنم. پیش‌نویسی از قانون حقوق کارگران آماده کردم. از بررسی همه‌ی قانون‌های کار جهان پیشرفته بهترین‌ها را برگزیدم. پیش‌نویس تنها به هدف استفاده در کارخانه‌ی خودمان نوشته شده بود. هنگامی که آن سند را به وزارت کار دادم، پسندیدند. کیفیت زندگی ۵۰۰۰ کارگر کارخانه بهبود یافت. سال ۱۹۷۵ شاه اعلام کشور یک‌حزبی کرد. وی از اتحاد می‌گفت ولی ناخوشایند بود زیرا با یک صدا نمی‌شود رهبری کرد. کار سیاسی تنها از درون حزب‌ رستاخیز می‌گذشت. اساس حزب همان قانون اساسی بود که دربرگیرنده‌ی سلطنت مشروطه و انقلاب سفید هم بود. آرمان را باید پی می‌گرفتم، سخن گفتن با مردم رهگشای آینده‌ی روشن است. بر آن شدم که در انتخابات بعدی از نهاوند نامزد شوم و آرمان‌هایم را برای ایران و ایرانیان در آن کارزار با مردم در میان بگذارم. میترا موافق نبود. گفت که من برای سیاست خیلی درستکارم، خیلی ناوارد هستم. او گفت: «حتا اگر پیروز شوی، تنها یک صدا هستی. بقیه‌ی مجلس همچنان تحت فرمان شاه خواهد بود.» پدرم نیز امیدی به پیروزی‌ من نداشت و نمی‌خواست دلشکسته شوم. بر آن بود که نامزدها باید مورد پذیرش شاه باشند، دو نفر دیگر  بختشان از این بابت بلند بود. یکی از آنها در کاخ با شاه و شهبانو والیبال بازی می‌کرد. دیگری معاون وزیر آموزش و پرورش کشور بود. به آن اندازه از پیروزی خود اطمینان داشت که از سمت خود کناره‌گیری کرده بود. پس از آنکه نامزدی خود را اعلان کردم، با من تماس گرفت. گفت: «تنها خواستم بدانی که همه‌ی دولتمردان از من پشتیبانی می‌کنند و این مقام از پیش به من وعده داده شده است.» پاسخ دادم: «برای شما خوشحالم. به پیروزی نمی‌اندیشم. برای شناساندن اندیشه‌هایم می‌آیم.»",

  "text": "(18/54) “The king threw a celebration on the 2500th anniversary of the Persian monarchy. It was the largest gathering of world leaders in history. He constructed a city of tents around the ruins of Persepolis, where Cyrus’s grandson Xerxes ruled the ancient world. 1500 cypress trees were planted in the middle of the desert. There were vast carpets of petunias and marigolds. The king opened the ceremony with a speech at the tomb of Cyrus The Great. As he spoke, his voice shook with emotion. He said: ‘Rest in peace, for we are awake. In a troubled world, Iran still bears the message of freedom and humanity. Even in the darkest times, the torch thou lit has never died.’ The king was at the height of his power. Oil prices were at record highs. With each passing year Iran grew wealthier and wealthier, and the king gathered more power into his hands. Every New Year I would gather the children together and read from Shahnameh about the story of Jamshid—the fourth king of Iran. Jamshid was the greatest king. The wisest king. The Iranian people gathered around him in adoration, and built him a throne of sapphires, emeralds, and rubies. He taught men to build buildings. He taught men to heal the sick. He unlocked all the secrets of the world. And his throne began to float into the air. With each new gift to the people, it rose higher. And higher. And higher. Until one day it rose too high. Jamshid lost touch with the people. He could no longer hear their voice. He no longer wanted their participation. He gathered his advisors around him, and announced: ‘All good things come from me. I am the maker of the world.’ As soon as he spoke these words, his throne began to fall. With tears of blood he begged for pardon, but none was given. And the dread of coming darkness was his lot.”  \n\nسال ۱۹۷۱ شاه جشن ۲۵۰۰ سالگی شاهنشاهی ایران را برگزار کرد. این جشن بزرگترین گردهمآیی سران دولت‌های جهان در تاریخ بود. شهری از چادرها پیرامون بازمانده‌های تخت جمشید بر پا شد، جایی که نوه‌ی کوروش بزرگ بر دنیای باستان فرمان می‌راند. ۱۵۰۰ درخت سرو در میانه‌ی دشت کاشتند. همراه با فرش‌های پهناوری از گل‌های اطلسی و همیشه‌بهار. شاه با سخنرانی در کنار آرامگاه کوروش بزرگ مراسم را آغاز کرد. صدایش از سنگینی آن لحظه‌ها لرزان بود. او گفت: «کوروش، آسوده بخواب زیرا که ما بیداریم. و‌ برای نگاهبانی میراث پرافتخار تو همواره بیدار خواهیم بود. ایران در پهنه‌ی پرآشوب جهان پیام‌آور آزادگی و مردمی و پاسدار والاترین آرمان‌های انسانی‌ست. ای کوروش، مشعلی که تو افروختی هرگز خاموش نشده است. ایران نگهبان پیام آزادی و مردمی در این جهان پر آشوب است، حتا در تاریک‌ترین لحظه‌ها.» در آن زمان شاه در اوج قدرت بود. بهای نفت به بالاترین حد رسیده بود. با گذشت هرسال بر دارایی‌های کشور و قدرت شاه افزوده می‌شد. هر سال نوروز، برای بچه‌ها داستان جمشید - چهارمین پادشاه ایران - را می‌خواندم. جمشید پادشاه بزرگ آفرینش و سازندگی‌ست. پادشاهی خردمند است. ایرانیان ستایش‌کنان پیرامون او گرد آمدند و تختی از یاقوت کبود، زمرد و یاقوت سرخ برایش ساختند. جمشید از رازهای جهان پرده ‌برداشت. ساختمان‌سازی را به مردم آموخت. دارو و درمان بیماری‌ها را، نوشتن و بوی‌های خوش را، هرآنچه به کار زندگی شاد و آسوده بینجامد، پنهان نماند. خرد او بر همه هویدا بود. فره او چندان درخشان بود که تخت او به  آسمان فرا رفت و ارجش با هر خدمت تازه به مردم فرا و فراتر رفت. غرورش چندان اوج گرفت که بزرگان کشور را فراخواند و گفت: چنین گفت با سالخورده مهان   /   که جز خویشتن را ندانم جهان   /   چو من نامور تخت شاهی ندید   /   جهان را به خوبی من آراستم   /   چنان است گیتی کجا خواستم. با راندن این سخنان بر زبان پیوندش با مردم گسست ،فره‌اش فروکاست. بختش رخت بربست. با اشک‌های خونین خواستار بخشایش شد، نابخشوده ماند. فرجامش دلشکار است",

  "text": "\"I was born deaf to a farmworker family, and I proudly attended Britain’s oldest free school for the Deaf at Margate in Kent. It was first established in Bermondsey in 1792 as the ‘Asylum for the Support and Education of the Deaf and Dumb Children of the Poor’ and, incredibly, it managed to keep going for over 2 centuries until, sadly, it was closed down in 2015. I've always been fascinated with history and bringing it back to life, and I believe strongly that to understand our present and future, we first have to know the past. As a child I loved going to archaeological excavations in Sussex, and as an adult I've joined in quite a few historical re-enactments too. But mudlarking is my passion. It involves searching for treasures along river beds, in my case the Thames, and I've found everything from Palaeolithic flintwork and musket balls to a modern camera with its tripod still attached. There's centuries of history buried down there, and now my hands aren't just for sign language - I use them to dig up the past too. It's also excellent stress therapy, as I tend to forget about everything else while I'm doing it. When I found a ‘plague’ clay tobacco pipe, used by someone in London in 1665 when the plague was rife, I drifted off into this long meditation about what it must have been like to live through those times, and how they desperately hoped smoking could 'ventilate' away the disease. \n\n\"I'm now a Deaf historian and lecturer at City Lit, working to recover the lost Golden Age of the British Deaf community. That was in the early 1800s, when the power of British Sign Language (BSL) made Deaf people strong and literate. Tragically, BSL was banned in 1880 after the 'Second International Congress on the Education of the Deaf' in Milan declared oral education was better than manual (sign). As a result, many deaf people felt disempowered and excluded and were left illiterate again. There was also a resurgence of discrimination. In 1976, when Raymond Lee co-founded the National Union of the Deaf (NUD) to try and strengthen the Deaf community again, he reminded everyone of Shakespeare’s powerful words: ‘In nature there‘s no blemish but the mind. None can be called deformed but the unkind.’\"\n\nPeter, photographed by Stephen for his Deaf Mosaic project.",

  "text": "\"I was born in rural Jamaica where my grandmother delivered me and brought me up for the first 13 years of my life, as my mother went back to Kingston to work as soon as I was born, and then to the UK when I was 7. We grandchildren were like an extension of her 15 kids, and I still miss her terribly, even after 50-odd years. She was an amazing woman who loved to laugh, very kind and sweet, loving and playful, but also fiercely protective. I think I learned to be all that from her. But when she died early, in her 60s, I was sent to the UK to be with my mother and I just wept for 3 years. I so desperately wanted to go back to Jamaica. \n\n\"I thought it was horrendous here - cold and grey and miserable, and so blatantly racist too. As part of the dominant culture back home in Jamaica, I'd never been exposed to that before. There was all sorts of name-calling, aggressions, impediments and oppressions. You still saw signs up saying 'No Blacks, No Dogs, No Irish' and it was almost impossible to find a place to rent. But, by the time I'd earned enough money to afford to go back I'd got used to it here, and I'd decided that I had the right to be, and that nothing was going to stop me doing what I wanted to do. That was such a relief and gave me so much more confidence and self-esteem.\n\n\"At 19 I married a white Englishman who was 20-plus years older than me and didn't have a racist bone in his body. He was a nice man, a good husband, and a great father to our 3 children, even after we divorced when Zadie, my eldest, was 15. That then gave me the freedom to grow into the fun, capable, energetic human I was meant to be. The world is essentially full of beautiful people, of all skin colours, and some of my longest and strongest friendships are with wonderful white women who've been my rocks. I think you have to be resilient, pick your battles, and never allow your spirit to be dampened, because life is just too precious.\" \n\nYvonne, HoGLed at her home in Queens Park, July 2018. \n\nBelow she talks about her lifelong love of the written word and how she was just starting to find her own writer's voice.

  "text": "(17/54) “We still took long walks together. Mitra hated walking through deep forests, they were too dark. She’d imagine that predators were hiding behind every tree. By that time I’d begun to organize the workers at my factory. I’d hold weekly meetings and speak to them about their rights, but Mitra wanted me to stop. She thought it was too dangerous to speak out in a closed society. The Shah had brought many freedoms to Iran, but there’s one place he stopped short: political freedom. No dissent was allowed. No criticism appeared in the media. And his secret police SAVAK had a reputation for violence. Many of his political opponents shared brutal stories of their treatment in prison. After our Niroo meetings Parvaneh became extremely anti-Shah. She was the basketball player; the one with the strongest voice. She married a fellow activist named Dariush Forouhar, and she joined the party he had formed. They wanted nothing less than full political freedom. And both of them went to jail several times for their views. Dr. Ameli tried to work within the system. He’d become a member of parliament, but when he spoke out against the king the Pan-Iranist Party was banned. The king saw himself as a king of old. He wanted to rule Iran with a single voice. One year I decided to write about the history of our factory. I saw it as a great example of the Iranian people coming together for a common cause. Forty thousand people were involved: materials had been contributed from local mines, a dam was constructed, an entire city was built for the workers. It had truly been a national project. I spent an entire year on the book. But before it could be published, it had to be reviewed by the secret police. They told me it could not be published unless it was dedicated to the leadership of the Shah. It was abhorrent to me. The Shah played a role, but the factory had been built by the people. By giving all the credit to one man—it takes away their authorship. I told them: ‘Write whatever you want. But take my name off it.’” \n\nپایان هفته‌ها به پیاده‌روی‌‌های طولانی می‌رفتیم. تلاش می‌کردیم که فضاهای باز را انتخاب کنیم زیرا میترا از پیاده‌روی در میانه‌ی جنگل بیزار بود. بیش از اندازه برای او تاریک می‌نمود. می‌پنداشت که مهاجمان در پس هر درختی به کمین نشسته‌اند. میترا همچنان تلاش می‌کرد که مرا از مبارزه‌ی سیاسی باز دارد. او برآن بود که سخن گفتن در جامعه‌ی بسته خطرناک است. برای رفاه کارگران با یاری چهار تن از همکاران برنامه‌ریزی‌هایی کردیم. در کمیته‌ی عالی رفاه که پس از کار روزانه گرد می‌آمدیم، برای کارکنان ذوب آهن قانون استخدامی مدرنی که در مقایسه با قانون‌های کشورهای اروپایی و ژاپن بهتر بود، نوشتیم. شاه آزادی‌های زیادی را برای ایران به ارمغان آورده بود ولی در یک جا کوتاهی می‌کرد: آزادی‌های سیاسی. صدای مخالفی را تحمل نمی‌کرد. هیچ‌گونه انتقادی در رسانه‌ها روا نبود. ساواک، در به کار بردن خشونت زبانزد بود. بسیاری از مخالفان سیاسی او داستان‌های دل‌آزاری از چگونگی رفتار در زندان بازگو کرده‌اند. پس از گردهم‌آیی‌های نیرو، پروانه بسیار ضد شاه شد. او بازیکن بسکتبال بود؛ صدایی رسا داشت و هیچ چیز مگر آزادی کامل سیاسی را نمی‌پذیرفت. او با همسرش داریوش فروهر در حزب ملت ایران فعال بود. چندین بار به دلیل دیدگاه‌هایش زندانی شده بود. دکتر عاملی تلاش کرده بود که در درون نظام به فعالیت بپردازد. نماینده‌ی مجلس شده بود، ولی هنگامی که علیه سیاست‌های شاه سخن گفته شد از فعالیت حزب پان‌ایرانیست جلوگیری کردند. شاه خود را از پادشاهان روزگار باستان می‌انگاشت. می‌خواست ایران را یکه و تنها رهبری کند. بر آن شدم که تاریخ کارخانه را بنویسم. آن را نمونه‌ای برجسته از همکاری مردم ایران برای هدفی مشترک می‌دیدم. چهل‌هزار نفر در کار ساختنش دست داشتند: تأمین مواد اولیه، از معادن بومی آهن و زغال سنگ فراهم آمده بود، سدی بزرگ برای تأمین آب کارخانه و پیرامون آن و شهری کامل با مکان‌های آموزشی، بهداشتی و رفاهی برای کارگران ساخته شده بود. به راستی که یک برنامه‌ی ملی بود. ولی پیش از انتشار کتاب، بایستی در ساواک بررسی می‌شد. پاسخ آنها چنین بود که این کتاب منتشر نمی‌شود مگر آنکه از شاه ستایش و به او پیشکش شود. برای من بسیار ناخوشایند بود. با وجود اینکه شاه در آن کار بزرگ نقش داشت، ولی کارخانه به دست مردم ساخته شده بود. واگذاری همه‌ی افتخارات به یک فرد - نقش مردم را بی‌اهمیت می‌کرد. یک سال تمام برای نوشتن آن کتاب کوشیده بودم. به آنها گفتم که می‌توانند نوشته‌هایم را هر گونه که می‌خواهند چاپ کنند ولی نام مرا از روی آن بردارند",

  "text": "(16/54) “When the children were old enough I started reading them Shahnameh before they went to sleep. The stories of Rostam were too violent. They’d cry and cry. So I started with the stories of Iran’s mythic kings. These were the first kings of Iran. They discovered fire, language, and law. Some of them spoke to animals. Others lived for hundreds of years and sat on floating thrones made entirely of precious stones. It’s not known if Ferdowsi intended to name his book Shahnameh. The Book of Kings. But the title fits. For as long as there has been an Iran, there has been a king. In 1967 Mohammed Reza held a coronation ceremony. By that time he’d already been king for twenty years. But he’d wanted his coronation to wait, until Iran was prosperous. And now it was. The Shah had come a long way since that day I’d first seen him in the shrine. He’d tightened his grip on power, and his popularity was at an all-time high. The White Revolution had been a massive success. Iran was rapidly industrializing. Millions of Iranians were lifted out of poverty. Hundreds of new schools and universities were built. And it was a time of great freedom. Iranian women had more rights than anywhere else in the Muslim world. They could vote, obtain a divorce, own property, and run for office. In the words of Saadi: ‘The homeland is where no one disturbs the other.’ In Tehran you could see women in mini-skirts standing next to women who were fully-veiled. On the day of his coronation The Shah rode to the palace in a golden carriage pulled by eight Hungarian stallions. As he passed the streets were filled with shouts of ‘Long Live The King!’ Trumpets blared. Guns fired. The Air Force dropped 17,532 roses from the sky. One for every day of his life. At the coronation a crown of diamonds was placed upon his head, and he took his seat on the famous Naderi throne. It was decorated with carvings of lions and dragons. And it was covered with 25,000 precious stones.” \n\nهنگامی که بچه‌ها به سن دبستان رسیدند، شب‌ها خواندن داستان‌های شاهنامه را پیش از خوابشان آغاز کردم. بسیاری از داستان‌های رستم پر از خون و‌خشونت بودند. آنها را به گریه می انداخت. بنابراین از داستان‌های پادشاهان افسانه‌ای ایران آغاز کردم. آنها نخستین پادشاهان ایران و جهان آشنای آن روزگار بودند. آفریننده‌ی آتش، زبان و قانون. برخی از آنان جانوران را رام و با آنان زندگی می‌کردند. برخی دیگر سدها سال زنده می‌ماندند و بر تخت‌هایی که از سنگ‌های گرانبها درست شده بودند، می‌نشستند. روشن نیست که آیا فردوسی می‌خواست نام کتابش شاهنامه باشد یا نه. ولی نامی زیبنده‌ی کتاب است. از نامه ی شهریاران پیش سخن می‌گوید: من این نامه‌ی شهریاران پیش   /   بگفتم بدین نغز گفتار خویش. پادشاهی از ایران برآمده است. در سال ۱۹۶۷ مراسم تاج‌گذاری‌اش برگزار شد. تا آن هنگام بیش از بیست سال از  پادشاهی‌اش گذشته بود. ولی او تاجگذاری‌اش را تا رسیدن به پیشرفت ایران به عقب انداخته بود. و اکنون  پیشرفتی به دست آمده بود. شاه از نخستین باری که او را در حرم دیده بودم راه بلندی را پیموده بود. او بر قدرت سیاسی‌اش افزوده و محبوبیتش به اوج رسیده بود. انقلاب سفیدش موفقیت‌آمیز بود. میلیون‌ها ایرانی از فقر رهایی یافته بودند. سدها مدرسه و دانشگاه نوین ساخته شده بود. ایران به سرعت در حال صنعتی شدن بود. و دوران آزادی‌های بزرگ فرا می‌رسید. زنان ایرانی نسبت به دیگر جاها در جهان اسلام از حقوق بیشتری برخوردار بودند. آنها می‌توانستند رأی بدهند، درخواست طلاق کنند، صاحب دارایی شوند و نامزد انتخابات گردند. سعدی چنین گفته بود: وطن آنجاست کآزاری نباشد   /   کسی را با کسی کاری نباشد. در تهران، زنانی را می‌شد دید که با دامن‌های کوتاه در کنار زنانی با چادر و حجاب کامل ایستاده‌اند. در روز تاجگذاری شاه سوار بر کالسکه‌ی سلطنتی زرین که به وسیله‌ی هشت اسب مجاری کشیده می‌شد به کاخش رفت. در طول راه، خیابان‌ها پر از مردمی بودند که فریاد «جاوید شاه!» سر می‌دادند. شیپورها نواخته شدند. تفنگ‌ها شلیک شدند. و نیروی هوایی ۱۷۵۳۲ عدد گل سرخ از آسمان رها کرد. یک گل برای هر روز زندگی‌اش. در آیین تاجگذاری، شاه تاجی با ۳۰۰۰ قطعه الماس بر سر نهاد و بر تخت نادری نشست. تختی آراسته به ۲۵۰۰۰ یاقوت کبود، زمرد و یاقوت سرخ",

  "text": "(15/54) “After my injury Mitra said it was finally time to be realistic. She began to use the words I would hear for the rest of my life: ‘You’ve already lost one eye for your ideals.’ I’d always respond the same way: “I’ve still got one eye left. And I’d like to see the world for as beautiful as it is.’ When we came home from Germany I promised that I’d never leave Iran again. Not even once. Not even on vacation. The only job I could find was at a steel factory. It wasn’t my ideal position. But wherever I am, I think of all of Iran. It was my hope that I could gain some experience and spearhead an industrial policy for the entire country. Inside the house Mitra was queen. She wanted everything in our house to be beautiful. She’d make entire booklets of beautiful things that she’d clipped from magazines: one for couches, one for lamps, one for tables. Mitra chose all of the children’s clothing. Sometimes they’d miss their bus because she was so particular. And whenever she decided—it was final. I tried to teach the children to use their voice. I’d tell them: ‘If you disagree with what I say, use your words.’ But Mitra was the opposite. She wanted her word to be the law, and that also applied to me. We once went to a famous carpet store in Tehran. Inside there were many beautiful trees. When Mitra asked the owner how he kept them so green, he said that every time he finishes a kettle of tea, he pours the remains on the roots of the trees. From that day on, Mitra made me pour the remains of our tea on the roots of our trees. She’d send me out in the middle of the night to do it. I tried to appeal to her reason. I told her that it made no sense. It was nonsensical. But inside our home her word was the law. Only once did I make a stand. When our youngest daughter was born, Mitra wanted to name her Kakoli—it’s a beautiful little bird with a plume on its head. But I had a different idea. We argued about it for weeks. And in the end we made a compromise. We agreed to call her Kakoli. But her name, would be Gordafarid.” \n\nمیترا امیدوار بود که پس از آسیب چشمم آرمانخواهی‌ام را کنار بگذارم. او سخنانی می‌گفت که تا امروز هم می‌گوید: «زمان آن رسیده که با واقعیت روبرو شوی. تو یکی از چشمانت را در راه آرمان‌هایت از دست داده‌ای.» و من همواره اینگونه پاسخ داده‌ام: «هنوز یک چشم برایم مانده. و می‌خواهم جهان را با همه‌ی زیبایی‌هایش ببینم.» زمانی که از آلمان به ایران برگشتیم، با خودم پیمان بستم که دیگر هرگز ایران را ترک نکنم. حتا برای گردش. نخستین کاری که پیدا کردم در کارخانه‌ی ذوب‌آهن بود. پیشه‌ی آرمانی‌ام نبود، ولی هر کجا که باشم همواره به ایران می‌اندیشم. امیدوار بودم تجربه‌ای کسب کنم و سپس پیشگام برنامه‌ای صنعتی برای همه‌ی کشور شوم. در خانه میترا شهبانو بود. دوست داشت در خانه‌مان همه چیز زیبا باشد. او دفترچه‌های کاملی از بریده‌ی مجله‌ها درست می‌کرد: یکی برای اسباب و اثاث خانه، یکی برای چراغ‌، یکی برای میز و صندلی. همه‌ی لباس‌های بچه‌ها را میترا انتخاب می‌کرد. آنها گاهی از اتوبوس جا می‌ماندند چون او بسیار نکته‌بین بود. و هرگاه تصمیمی می‌گرفت، نهایی بود. همیشه تلاش می‌کردم به بچه‌ها بیاموزم که اندیشه‌های خودشان را بیان کنند. به آنها می‌گفتم: «اگر با آنچه که من می‌گویم همسو نیستید، نظر خودتان را بگویید.» ولی میترا آنگونه نبود. می‌خواست که گفتار او قانون باشد. و این امر شامل من نیز می‌شد. یکبار به فرش‌فروشی پر‌آوازه‌ای در تهران رفتیم. درون فروشگاه  درختچه‌های زیبای بسیاری دیده می‌شدند. میترا از صاحب فروشگاه پرسید چگونه  آنها را سبز و خرم نگه می‌دارد. گفت هر بار که قوری چای تمام می‌شود، تفاله چای را به پای درختانش می‌ریزد. از آن پس، میترا مرا وادار می‌کرد که مانده چای‌مان را پای درختان بریزم. نیمه‌شب‌ها مرا وا می‌داشت که برای این کار به بیرون بروم. سعی کردم که بخردانه با او گفت‌وگو کنم. به او گفتم که این کار بیهوده  است. خردمندانه  نیست. ولی در خانه، سخن او قانون بود. تنها یک بار به ناسازگاری با او برخاستم. هنگامی که دومین دخترمان به دنیا آمد. میترا می‌خواست او را کاکُلی بنامد که نام پرنده‌ی‌ کوچک زیبایی‌ست با تاجی بر سر. ولی من خیال دیگری داشتم. هفته‌ها در اینباره گفت‌وگو کردیم. و در پایان با هم کنار آمدیم. به این توافق رسیدیم که او را کاکُلی بخوانیم ولی نامش گُردآفرید باشد",

As well as being vital to reduce the spread, they serve as an important reminder of the seriousness of the situation we're in, and a sign that we're protecting and caring for others. But after a while I decided that maybe the medical look of so many masks on the street was a bit impersonal and adding to the gloom? I thought 'Why not be more stylish, as well as safe, and maybe add a touch of humour to lift our spirits too?' I taught design and technology for 38 years. Since I retired 6 years ago I've been designing and making flamboyant hats and costumes for people, events and shows, as well as developing a more colourful style of my own, and I was determined that this new 'stay-at-home life' was not going to make me slide back into drabness and normality. Also I needed an escape and a creative distraction. So I started recycling my silk ties into masks and added sunglasses and hats to take some crazy self portraits. \n\n\"When Helena decided to go to work as these different characters (see previous post), I spent weeks visiting local charity shops to fill up our dressing-up box. She had fun putting the outfits together and I'd create their matching masks. I won't be surprised if she keeps this going long after COVID as the little ones love it. In fact it cheers everyone up, and that’s got to be a good thing. As every artist and performer knows, it's important for adults to keep playing and using their imaginations too!\"\n\nRichard, in the first picture wearing one of his earliest prototype masks. \"Though uncharacteristically lacking in colour, it was spreading the message that you wear a mask to protect others more than yourself.\"",

My husband Richard is vulnerable, so I decided I needed to wear a mask to protect him as well as my colleagues. But there was also the view that teachers need their faces to be seen to communicate efficiently and not scare the children. Then I had an idea - why not make it less scary and more fun by creating whole characters with head-to-toe outfits and matching masks? Richard is an endlessly creative and very artistic designer, maker and photographer. So he made and embroidered almost all of my masks, then we’d do the finishing touches and embellishments together and photograph the completed character for fun. \n\n\"Every morning when the children arrived at school they were curious to see who they'd meet, asking 'What will Helena be today?!' When I walked in, it was so wonderful to see lots of them looking at me in awe, with bright, shining eyes. Instead of being a barrier it provided opportunities for connection and social and emotional education. In character, I was making them smile and starting conversations, helping them to develop their communication skills, empathy, imagination and vocabulary. When a child was upset, I could divert their attention by talking about the character I was in, using it's own special voice or movements, and reciting relevant nursery rhymes or singing songs. I'd improvise stories and we'd play roles and practice seeing other’s points of view to resolve upsets. It's a difficult and scary time for us all, but this really helped me to cope and gave me a focus, whilst also providing a safe, fun and stimulating environment for the children. It also freed me up, allowing me to play and be a bit cheeky, which I enjoyed. I'll definitely look forward to creating more characters in the future. It might even become a ‘thing’ in the nursery?\" \n\nHelena, photographed by Richard in an improvised studio at their home in Enfield.",

  "text": "(3/3) \"I'd always felt alone, just me against the world. I was always trying to please others, and I didn't think I was worthy of any help myself. But finding that there were all these people who wanted to stand beside me and support me really boosted my self-esteem. I also learned the importance of getting enough rest and looking after myself, and I finally gained enough confidence to speak up. Now I'm a Parent Champion and FGC Advocate myself, so I'm able to help alleviate other parents' fears, and give them and their children a chance to speak for themselves, not just bow their heads and allow people in positions of power to tell them what to do. I give lectures about my story and good social work practice to people with Masters degrees, and I work with the Family Advisory Board too, to make sure that people who are as vulnerable as I once was are treated with respect and listened to. I ask people 'Would it have been an injustice if she'd been taken away from me?' and 'Do you think she would have achieved what she has if she had been?' Social workers should always treat us as humans, not make assumptions or jump to conclusions, and give us more agency in our own lives too. Doing this work has also opened doors for me that I never thought I'd walk through - I've even been invited to a garden party at Buckingham Palace!\n\n\"Sav's 9 now and I couldn't be more proud of her. She actually won 'Primary Engineer of the Year' when she was 7, after she invented an extendable sink when the chemo left me too weak to reach it to wash my hands. One social worker described me as 'hyper-vigilant' because I'm the mum who'll email the school 15 times a month! Obviously I can't wrap her in cotton wool, but I alone know what I went through to have this child, so I'm not going to allow anything bad to happen to her on my watch, and if I think something's out of order, I'm going to say so. Having her feels like a God-given gift and has made me believe that whoever's up there has my best interests at heart. I feel so lucky and grateful that I really want to become a transformational speaker to help others overcome their challenges, and now I have 24 godchildren too.\" \n\nFaye, phone-HoGLed by Beth (3/3)",

  "text": "(14/54) “We began in darkness. Three hundred years after the Battle of Nahavand. The invaders had plundered the country. Caravans of riches were leaving day and night. There was a huge push to break our unity, to erase our identity, to make us forget ourselves. And whenever a conqueror tries to destroy a people, they begin with the language. Scholars were murdered. Books were burned. Entire libraries were razed to the ground. Whenever words were found, they were destroyed. A knight gathered all the texts that remained. And Ferdowsi stepped forward to weave them into a poem. In the prologue of Shahnameh he writes: ‘I am building a castle of words. That no wind or rain will destroy!’ Ferdowsi attempted to use only the purest form of Persian. He wanted to preserve the entirety of our language. All of our words. But it wasn’t just our language that he was trying to save, it was our story. Our wisdom. Our soul. Who we were. Ferdowsi drew from many different sources when writing Shahnameh. But one of the most important was The Avesta. The holiest book in ancient Iran. It included many of our oldest stories, from before the written word. In the heart of the book, away from the edges, safe from the sands of time, were the oldest words of Iran: the seventeen hymns of Zoroaster. They were three thousand years old.  And they’re in the form of a poem. They tell the story of a battle between two great spirits: Ahura Mazda and Ahriman. Good and Evil. Light and Dark. Since the beginning of time these two spirits have been locked in a battle for the soul of the world. And every person must participate. There can be no spectators. There is always a choice to be made. Light or Dark. Good or Evil. 𝘕𝘦𝘦𝘬𝘪 or 𝘉𝘢𝘥𝘪. It’s a simple choice. But in that choice is an escape from destiny. A promise that the book is not yet written. There is still a role for us to play.” \n\nدر تاریکی آغاز شد. سیسد سال پس از جنگ نهاوند غارتگران دارایی‌های سرزمین ما را به تاراج برده بودند. کاروان‌های انباشته از زر و گوهر روز و شب خارج می‌شدند. کارزار فراگیری برای از میان بردن هویت ایرانی به راه انداخته بودند. از زبان‌مان آغاز کردند. هر گاه فاتحی کمر به نابودی ملتی ببندد، بخواهد هویت آنها را از بین ببرد، بخواهد اتحاد آنها را بشکند، بخواهد آنها را از خود بیگانه کند، از زبان می‌آغازد. زبان آوند فرهنگمان است. نگهدارنده‌ی تمامی گذشته‌مان است. چسبی‌ست که ما را در کنار هم نگه می‌دارد. دانشمندان کشته شدند. کتاب‌ها سوزانده شدند. تمامی کتابخانه‌ها با خاک یکسان شدند. هر گاه نوشته‌هایی یافت می‌شد، نابود می‌کردند. فردوسی می‌نویسد که پهلوانی همه‌‌ی نوشته‌های بازمانده را گرد‌ آورد. سپس فردوسی پذیرفت تا همه را به شعر برگرداند. او چنین سرود: پی افکندم از نظم کاخی بلند   /   که از باد و باران نیابد گزند! فردوسی کوشید که از ناب‌ترین واژگان فارسی استفاده کند. می‌خواست یکپارچگی زبان‌مان را پاس دارد. ولی این تنها واژگان‌مان نبودند که در تلاش پاسداری از آن بود، بلکه داستانهای‌مان نیز بود. جان و روان و شناسه‌ی ما. آنچه که بودیم. در نوشتن شاهنامه، فردوسی از منابع گوناگون بسیاری بهره ‌برد. برجسته‌ترین آنها اوستا بود. کتاب سپنتای ایران. دربرگیرنده‌ی کهن‌ترین داستانهای‌مان از دوردست روزگار. در دل کتاب، دور از متن‌های حاشیه‌ای، در امان از گردباد زمانه، کهن‌ترین واژگان ‌‌و سخنان و نوشته‌های ایران گنجانده شده بود: هفده گاتای زرتشت. با قدمتی سه‌هزارساله که  به شعر نوشته شده‌اند. داستان نبرد میان دو نیروی بزرگ را روایت می‌کند: اهورا مزدا و اهریمن. نیکی و بدی. روشنایی و تاریکی. از ازل، این دو نیرو در نبردی همیشگی برای جان جهان بوده‌اند. همه می‌بایست در آن نبرد شرکت کنند. هیچ تماشاگری وجود ندارد. چرا که هر انسانی باید انتخاب کند. همیشه گزینه‌ای وجود دارد. گزینه‌ی ساده‌ای‌ست: روشنایی یا تاریکی. نیکی یا بدی. ولی در آن گزینش، گریزی از سرنوشت وجود دارد. نویدی‌ست نانوشته. که در آن کارسازیم",

  "text": "(13/54) “In Germany we started a family. When our first daughter was born we named her Ahang. Ferdowsi uses the word a lot in Shahnameh. It means melody, but it also means willpower. Eighteen months later our son Maziar arrived. After the children were born Mitra said it was time to choose a normal profession, and secure the life that we had. At university I studied mechanical engineering. But wherever I am, I think of all of Iran. There were many Iranian students living in Germany, so I started my own version of Niroo called the Assembly of Kaveh, after one of Shahnameh’s greatest champions. Kaveh is a special champion. He was a normal man. An ordinary blacksmith. But he rallies the people to defeat Zahak—the most evil king in all of Shahnameh. Our meetings were held in the back room of a local tavern. The meetings were more cultural than political, each week we’d lecture on a different topic. But I was outspoken about my support for the White Revolution. We’d lost half our family’s land as part of the land reform, but still: I supported it. I wrote my father a letter. I said: ‘Today we can hold our heads higher, because there is more freedom in Iran.’ One day we were in the middle of a meeting when the door was kicked in. Two hundred angry men rushed into the room. They were mainly members of a leftist group, but they’d also been infiltrated by The Shah’s secret police, SAVAK. Their agents had been tasked with creating conflict between student groups. The men went around the room, knocking over furniture. One of them broke a coke bottle against the table, and wielded it as a weapon. I stood up from my chair and rolled my papers in my hand. I said: ‘Please, sit down. Let us discuss. Let us use our words.’ One of them was dressed exactly like Fidel Castro. He picked up a chair and jabbed its leg directly into my eye. Blood started streaming from my face. My friends picked me off the floor and helped me to the basement of the tavern. After a few minutes a police car arrived to take me to the hospital, and I was loaded in the back. I began to lose consciousnesses. The last thing I remember was a horrible, sharp pain in my eye. Then everything turned to black.” \n\nمیترا و من در آلمان صاحب دختری شدیم. نامش را آهنگ نهادیم. این واژه‌ای‌ست که فردوسی در شاهنامه بارها به کار برده است. به معنای نغمه و آواز، به معنای اراده‌ی راسخ نیز هست. هجده ماه پس از او  پسرمان مازیار پا به دنیا نهاد. پس از به دنیا آمدن فرزندان‌مان، میترا از من خواست که پیشه‌ای معمولی برگزینم. آسایش و آرامشی داشته باشیم. در دانشگاه، مهندسی مکانیک می‌خواندم. ولی هر جا باشم، ایران با من است. از آنجا که در آلمان دانشجویان ایرانی بسیار بودند، پس از رایزنی با دوستان بر آن شدیم که سازمانی فرهنگی-سیاسی برپا کنیم. نامش را «انجمن ملی کاوه» نهادیم، به افتخار یکی از نامدارترین پهلوانان شاهنامه. کاوه پهلوانی‌ست ویژه. او از تبار آزاده مردمان بود. آهنگری ساده. ولی بر ضحاک، پلیدترین شاه شاهنامه شورید. دیدار هفتگی‌مان را در اتاقی ویژه‌ی نشست‌ها و گردهمآیی‌ها در  میخانه‌ا‌ی محلی برگزار می‌کردیم. هر هفته به جُستار متفاوتی می‌پرداختیم: تاریخ، شعر، ادبیات، معماری و جز آن. گردهمآیی‌هایمان بیشتر فرهنگی بود تا سیاسی. ولی من انقلاب سفید را نیز پشتیبان بودم. با اصلاحات ارضی نیمی از زمین‌های خانوادگی‌مان از دست رفته بود ولی من با خرسندی به پدرم نوشتم که: «امروز می‌توانیم سرمان را بالاتر بگیریم زیرا عدالت، آزادی و آسایش بیشتری در ایران پدید می‌آید.» شبی در میانه‌ی گردهمآیی‌مان ناگهان در اتاق باز شد. چند سد تن از مردان خشمگین به اتاق ما یورش آوردند. ما بیست‌و‌‌‌چند تن بودیم. آنان اعضا و هواداران کنفدراسیون دانشجویان ایرانی بودند. کنگره‌ی سالانه‌شان را در شهر ما برپا کرده بودند. ساواک درگیری میان دانشجویان ایرانی را به سود خود می‌دانست. بیشتر آنان طرفداران چپ وابسته به سیاست‌های شوروی و دیگر کشورهای کمونیستی بودند و با ناسیونالیسم و انقلاب سفید مخالفت داشتند. یکی از آنها بطری نوشابه‌ای را شکست و به هوا برد. یکی که مانند فیدل کاسترو لباس پوشیده بود دور اتاق چرخید و پس از پرسیدن نام من روی میز جلوی من نشست. کاغذهایم را لوله کردم و از جا برخاستم. گفتم: «خواهش می‌کنم بنشینید تا با هم گفت‌وگو کنیم.» او صندلی را برداشت و پایه‌ی آن را یکراست به چشم راست من کوبید. دوستان، مرا به زیرزمین میخانه رساندند که ایمن‌تر بود. مهاجمان آمبولانسی را که برای بردن من رسیده بود، واژگون کردند. ناگزیر مرا در ماشین پلیس به بیمارستان رساندند. آرام آرام هوشیاری‌ام از دست می‌رفت. آخرین چیزی که به یاد دارم، احساس دردی شدید در چشمم بود. دیگر چیزی به یاد ندارم",

  "text": "(12/54) “She was brave in many ways. But there were three things that Mitra feared most: darkness, silence, and being alone. In Germany we’d take long walks through the countryside. Mitra couldn’t stand the quiet. She’d recite entire poems back-to-back-to-back. At the time she’d gotten into modern poetry. Her favorite poet was a young woman named Forough Farrokzhad. Mitra had many of her poems memorized. Farrokzhad was a modern poet. She wrote in free verse. She wrote from a feminine perspective. And she wrote about everything, including sex. By the time we finished Shahnameh I think I’d destroyed Mitra’s interest in the book. The book’s longest section is the historical section. Here the heroic nature of the prose fades. There are no more dragons. No more Rostam and Gordafarid. Here Ferdowsi writes about real people. He must stick to what is known. You can’t turn a real person into a mythic hero. That summer I took a road trip home to Iran. The Shah had just announced his White Revolution. It was a sweeping campaign of reform. Women were given the right to vote. Factory workers gained a share in profits. Agricultural estates were seized and redistributed to the sharecroppers who worked the fields. With a single stroke of his pen, the Shah gave more freedom to millions of Iranians. But not everyone supported it. When I arrived in Tehran the city was in chaos. Several buildings on my street were in flames. A cleric named Khomeini had come out against The White Revolution, and he’d ordered his followers to riot. Khomeini practiced a different kind of Islam. This was not the Islam of our fathers. This was not the Islam of the Persian Mystics. This was an Islam of cutting off hands, death for nonbelievers, and oppression of women. We thought these things were demons from our history. Monsters buried far in our past. But there’s a parable in 𝘔𝘢𝘴𝘯𝘢𝘷𝘪, where Rumi writes about a dragon frozen in a block of ice. The dragon seems to be dead. So the people place him on a cart and wheel him into the center of the city. They’ll soon discover that he’s still alive. He was only sleeping, waiting for things to heat up.” \n\nمیترا در بسیاری کارها بی‌باک بود ولی از سه چیز می‌ترسید: تاریکی، سکوت و تنهایی. در آلمان به پیاده‌روی‌های طولانی پیرامون شهر می‌رفتیم. میترا تحمل خاموشی را نداشت. پی در پی شعرهایی را به طور کامل می‌خواند. در آن هنگام شاعر دلخواه او  فروغ فرخزاد بود. فرخزاد شاعری نوگرا بود. او شاعر سبک نو بود. شعرهای او دیدگاه‌های زنانه داشتند. در هر زمینه‌ای می‌نوشت، حتا سکس. قشر مذهبی جامعه، او را زنی هرزه می‌خواند. میترا بسیاری از شعرهای او را به یاد سپرده بود. یک سال طول کشید تا شاهنامه را با هم خواندیم. هنگامی که خواندن را به پایان رساندیم، فکر می‌کنم از دلبستگی‌اش به شاهنامه کاسته بودم. بلندترین بخش کتاب بخش تاریخی آن است. در اینجا، سرشت حماسی سخن کم‌رنگ می‌شود. دیگر خبری از افسون و جادو نیست. از اژدها. از رستم و گردآفرید. در این بخش، فردوسی درباره‌ی انسان‌های واقعی می‌نویسد. هنگام نوشتن تاریخ باید به واقعیت‌ها پایبند بود. نمی‌توان شخصی عادی را به پهلوانی اسطوره‌ای تبدیل کرد. درآن تابستان، سفری زمینی به ایران داشتم. شاه به تازگی انقلاب سفید را اعلام کرده بود. یک کارزار فراگیر اصلاحات بود. زمین‌های کشاورزی زمین‌داران بزرگ به بهایی اندک به کشاورزانی که روی آن کار می‌کردند داده می‌شد. زنان از حق رأی برخوردار می‌شدند. سهمی از سود کارخانه‌ها به کارگران می‌رسید. در یک رفراندم به میلیون‌ها ایرانی آزادی بیشتری رسید. اما همه از آن پشتیبانی نمی‌کردند. هنگامی که به تهران رسیدم، چندین ساختمان را آتش زده بودند. یک روحانی به نام خمینی علیه انقلاب سفید قیام کرده و به پیروانش دستور شورش داده بود. خمینی به گونه‌ی دیگری از اسلام باور داشت. این اسلام پدران ما نبود. این اسلام عارفان ایرانی نبود. این اسلام بریدن دست‌ها و کشتن آزادی‌خواهان و ستمگری علیه زنان بود. اینها را اهریمنانی برخاسته از تاریخ‌مان می‌پنداشتیم. دیوهایی که در سال‌های دور به خاک سپرده بودیم. مولانا حکایتی در مثنوی دارد که در آن اژدهایی در تکه یخی منجمد شده است. گویی که مُرده است. از این‌ رو، مردم آن را بر ارابه‌ای نهاده و به مرکز شهر می‌برند. ولی بزودی در می‌یابند که اژدها هنوز زنده است. تنها در خواب بوده است و در آرزوی گرما. مرده بود و زنده گشت او از شگفت   /   اژدها بر خویش جنبیدن گرفت",

Thankfully, after the nurses from the neonatal unit told everyone how I'd been there with her all day every day, I was allowed to keep Sav and just given a Monitoring Order. But the new social worker and family support worker assigned to me closed my case soon after, because they saw I was a great mum and there was nothing they needed to do. Sav is super-bright - with my help she was reading by the age of 2, and I was thrilled to finally have the child I'd longed for for so many years. But I knew something was wrong with me because I kept falling asleep while I was with her, and in 2013 I was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. \n\n\"I was estranged from my family at the time, and I didn't want to bother my neighbours, so I called Camden Social Services and told them I really needed help. This time, instead of assigning a social worker, they offered me a meeting with a Family Group Conference (FGC) Co-ordinator. Her name was Christina and she got me to put together a list of 10 people who might be able to help and support me. All 10 of them came to the meeting - the family group conference, 15 more offered to help when they could, and we all made a plan. It was incredible. I was given the chance to create a community of people who knew me and I felt comfortable with, and their willingness to help me really boosted my faith in humanity. They brought food over, helped clean and organise our home, and took care of Sav or sat with me for hours while I was in hospital having chemo.\"  \n\nFaye, phone-HoGLed by Beth (2/3)",

  "text": "(11/54) Before our wedding Mitra’s father gave her one final piece of advice: ‘Never let a man enforce his opinions on you.’ And she took it to heart. She was my opposite. My antithesis. The hardest for me to convince. She would tell me I was too optimistic. She’d say that I only saw the best in things, whether that be people, Iran, or Shahnameh. After our marriage I finally convinced her to read it with me. We’d just moved to Germany so that I could attend university. Each night when I came home from class, she’d lay her head in my lap and I’d read her a chapter. It was my second time reading the book all the way through. My first time as an adult. As a boy I’d always been drawn to Rostam’s feats of strength: his taming of Rakhsh, his defeat of the demon king, his slaying of the dragon.  But now I noticed something else. Rostam lived by a code. He would not serve an evil king. He would only serve his ideals. 𝘋𝘢𝘢𝘥. Justice. 𝘙𝘢𝘴𝘵𝘪. Truth. And most of all, 𝘈𝘻𝘢𝘥𝘪. Freedom. Rostam would never sacrifice his freedom. The great champions of Shahnameh were more than warriors, they were vessels for our ideals. Even in the darkest times, even in the times of greatest danger, they lived by their code. I did my best to interest Mitra in certain parts. When I came to the story of the female knight Gordafarid, I quickened my pace. I filled my words with excitement: ‘The battle was nearly lost. Gordafarid’s commander had been captured on the battlefield. Her castle was completely surrounded by the enemy. Gordafarid tried to rally the men to fight, but none would join her. They wanted to stay behind the castle walls. They wanted to surrender. Gordafarid’s cheeks turned black with rage. She grabbed her bow and arrow, tied her hair beneath her helmet, and rode out to face the enemy alone. She stopped just short of the enemy lines, and like a lion she roared: 𝘞𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘦 𝘢𝘳𝘦 𝘺𝘰𝘶𝘳 𝘤𝘩𝘢𝘮𝘱𝘪𝘰𝘯𝘴?’ In the heat of the story, I peeked down at Mitra to see if she was scared. But she’d fallen asleep.” \n\nپیش از ازدواجمان پدر میترا آخرین اندرز را به او داد: «هرگز اجازه نده مردی به تو زور بگوید.» و او آن درس را جانانه پذیرفته بود. و ما در تمام زندگی‌مان چنین بوده‌ایم. او همواره آنتی‌تِز من بوده است. نقطه‌ی مقابل من. سرسخت‌ترین کس برای متقاعد شدن. می‌گفت بیش از اندازه آرمانخواهم، بیش از اندازه ناآزموده و بیش از اندازه باورمند. می‌گفت که من همیشه بهترین‌ را در هر چیزی می‌بینم، چه مردم باشد، چه ایران و چه شاهنامه. پس از ازدواجمان سرانجام توانستم او را راضی کنم که همراه من شاهنامه بخواند. دوران دانشجویی را در آلمان زندگی می‌کردیم. و هر شب که از دانشگاه به خانه برمی‌گشتم، سرش را روی پاهایم می‌گذاشت و من بخشی از شاهنامه را برایش می‌خواندم. این دومین بار بود که شاهنامه را از آغاز تا پایان ‌خواندم. نخستین بار در بزرگسالی. در کودکی همواره شیفته‌ی نبردهای رستم بوده‌ام: رام کردن رخش، شکست دیوان، کشتن اژدهای پیدا و پنهان. ولی آن روز به نکته‌ی دیگری پی برده بودم. رستم برپایه‌ی یک قانون زندگی می‌کرد. او به پادشاه ستمگر خدمت نمی‌کرد. او‌ تنها به راه آرمان‌هایش می‌کوشید: داد، راستی و بالاتر از همه، آزادی برایش ارجمندترین بود. رستم هرگز از آزادی‌اش نمی‌گذشت. پهلوانان بزرگ شاهنامه فراتر از جنگجویانی نیرومند بودند. آنها نگهدارنده‌ی آرمان‌های‌مان بودند. حتا در تاریک‌ترین زمانها، حتا در بزرگترین خطرها، پیرو قانون پهلوانی خود بودند. من بیشترین تلاش خود را می‌کردم که میترا را دلبسته‌ی بخش‌های ویژه‌ای از شاهنامه کنم. هنگامی که به داستان گردآفرید رسیدم، شتابم را بیشتر کردم. واژ‌گان را با شور بیشتری خواندم. دژ سپید به محاصره‌ی دشمن درآمده بود، هجیر نگهبان دژ بود. به جنگ سهراب رفت و به کمند او گرفتار شد. هنگامی که گردآفرید آگاه شد، گونه‌هایش از شدت خشم به سیاهی گرایید: چنان ننگش آمد ز کار هجیر   /   که شد لاله‌رنگش به کردار قیر. پس تیر و کمان خود را برداشت. گیسوانش را به زیر کلاه خود گرد آورد، و یکه و تنها بر دشمن تاخت. به نزدیکی سپاه دشمن ایستاد و چون شیر غرید: به پیش سپاه اندر آمد چو گرد   /   چو رعد خروشان یکی ویله کرد   /   که گردان کدامند و جنگ‌آوران   /   دلیران و کارآزموده سران. در اوج داستان نگاهی زیرچشمی به میترا انداختم تا ببینم که آیا ترسیده است. او به خواب رفته بود",

  "text": "(10/54) “Mitra loved anything beautiful. She kept countless notebooks. And on every page she’d paste something beautiful: a flower, a feather, a line from a poem. One time we went to a large antique shop, and the owner challenged us to choose the most expensive items in the shop. Mitra looked around the store and chose two that nobody else had noticed. The owner was shocked. He announced that those were the only two that were not for sale. She had a genius for beauty. It was one of her greatest gifts. But her greatest gift by far, was her memory. Mitra could memorize an entire poem after hearing it a single time. Her favorite was Hafez: The Prince of Romance. She’d memorized two hundred of his ghazals. And whenever she found a verse that she loved, she’d bring it to me to read. We’d heard our voices many times before in arguments. But it was different when we read poetry. There was a softness, a delicacy. When you’re reading a poem, you must find the 𝘢𝘩𝘢𝘯𝘨. Melody. The instrument is your throat. And the words are the notes. Some you strike suddenly—with a bang. Others you unroll gently, like a bow being slowly pulled across the string of a violin. Every word has life. Every word has its own soul. The word roar has a soul. 𝘒𝘩𝘰𝘳𝘰𝘰𝘴𝘩! And so does the word kiss. 𝘉𝘰𝘰𝘴𝘦𝘩. We were married in the traditional way. It was a small ceremony at the home of Mitra’s father. On the morning of our wedding Mitra and I visited a famous photographer in Tehran. We took a series of photographs standing side-by-side. She was so conscious of her crippled hand, she found a way to hide it in every photo. But she’d never looked so beautiful. When the session was finished, I suggested one final photograph. I could tell the photographer was annoyed, but he agreed. And it’s the photograph that still hangs in our house today. Mitra is sitting on a chair. And I’m down on one knee, looking up at her, holding her hand.” \n\nمیترا هر چیز زیبایی را دوست داشت. در دفترچه‌های پُرشُمارش و بر هر برگی از آنها چیزی زیبا می‌چسباند: گُلی، پَری، بیت شعری. روزی میترا و من به عتیقه‌فروشی بزرگی رفتیم -  فروشنده ما را به چالش کشید که گران‌ترین‌هایش را شناسایی کنیم. میترا نگاهی به پیرامون انداخت و به دو قطعه اشاره کرد. صاحب فروشگاه شگفت‌زده گفت که هیچ‌کس تا کنون به آنها توجه نکرده بود. او گفت که این دو تنها چیزهایی هستند که فروشی نیستند. میترا نبوغ ویژه‌ای در زیباشناسی داشت. یکی از بهترین توانایی‌های او بود. ولی برجسته‌ترین توانایی او حافظه‌اش بود. میترا پس از یک بار شنیدن شعر، ‌بسیاری از آنرا به یاد می‌سپرد. عاشق شعر بود. تنها زمینه‌ای که بر آن توافق داشتیم. شاعر مورد علاقه‌‌اش حافظ بود: شاهزاده‌ی عاشقانه‌ها. میترا بیش از دویست غزل او را از بر داشت. برخی را که دلپسندش بود به من می‌داد تا بخوانم. باور داشت که من آهنگ درست شعر را پیدا می‌کنم. صدای همدیگر را در بگومگوهامان بسیار می‌شنیدیم. ولی هنگام شعر ‌خواندن چنان نبود. حالتی از دلپذیری و نرمش. در شعر، حنجره ساز شماست. و واژه‌ها نُت‌هایتان. برخی را ناگهان می‌نوازی - با آوایی بلند. برخی دیگر را به آرامی، مانند کشیدن آرشه بر زه. هر واژه‌ ویژگی خود را دارد. هر واژه‌ را جانی دیگر است. واژه‌ی خروشیدن جانی خروشان دارد! همانگونه که واژه‌ی بوسیدن و بوسه، دلآویزی و آرامشش را! پیوند ما ازدواجی سنتی بود. جشن کوچکی در خانه‌ی پدر میترا. بامداد روز ازدواجمان، به آتلیه‌ی عکاسی پرآوازه‌ای در تهران رفتیم. میترا را هیچگاه به آن زیبایی ندیده بودم. چندین عکس ایستاده در کنار هم گرفتیم. در هر عکسی حالتی را می‌یافت تا دست چپش را پنهان کند. هنگامی که کارمان تمام شد، پیشنهاد عکسی دیگر دادم. عکاس آزرده می‌نمود اما عکس را گرفت. و آن همین است که تا امروز بر دیوار آویزان است. میترا روی صندلی نشسته و من یک زانو بر زمین نهاده، محو تماشای او، دستش را در دست گرفته‌ام",

  "text": "(9/54) “The club was called 𝘕𝘪𝘳𝘰𝘰 The Force. There were ten of us. We were all so different. But we were like charms on a bracelet—united by our love for Iran. It was nothing important: we’d graffiti our slogans onto walls. We’d stand on busy street corners and try to convert people to our cause. But it felt so important. We felt like we were building a new Iran around us. We held our meetings in an attic. We’d check the street for spies before we went inside. I had one of the strongest voices in the group, so I’d open each meeting by reciting a hymn about loving Iran. We’d review our activities from the previous week. Then Dr. Ameli would lead us in long discussions about the meaning of Iran. Dr. Ameli was a nationalist. But it wasn’t a nationalism of expansion. It was a nationalism of preservation. A nationalism based on history and culture, with respect for all people. That’s one of the very first things he taught us: ‘What is true, must be true for everyone.’ We learned that the Persian Empire began when Cyrus The Great united a group of nomadic tribes in 550 BC. Many consider Cyrus to be the founder of human rights. Whenever he conquered a new territory, he outlawed slavery. He allowed everyone to live with their own language and religion. In the ancient world Iranians were known as 𝘈𝘻𝘢𝘥𝘦𝘩. Free people. It’s even in the Shahnameh. When one of our champions is mistaken for an angel, he says: ‘I come from Iran. The land of the free.’ Listening to Dr. Ameli speak about the foundations of Iran, we felt like we’d discovered something hidden. An Iran built on ideals. 𝘙𝘢𝘴𝘵𝘪. 𝘕𝘦𝘦𝘬𝘪. 𝘋𝘢𝘢𝘥. An Iran built on freedom. 𝘈𝘻𝘢𝘥𝘪. During the final meetings of 𝘕𝘪𝘳𝘰𝘰 that I ever attended, we were joined by a girl named Parvaneh. She was a basketball player; and her voice was just as strong as mine. At the close of each meeting, we’d lead the group in the swearing of seven oaths. I don’t remember all seven, but I remember the final. To give our lives for Iran.” \n\nگروه خود را نیرو می‌نامیدیم. ده تن بودیم با ویژگی‌های گوناگون ولی چون مهره‌های یک دستبند - پیوسته و  همپیمان در عشق به ایران. کارهای برجسته‌ای نمی‌کردیم: شعارهامان را بر دیوارها می‌نوشتیم. در خیابان‌های پر رفت و آمد ایستاده و رهگذران را با آرمان‌هامان و برای پیوستن به کوشش‌ها فرامی‌خواندیم. اندیشه‌ها را با همگان در میان می‌گذاشتیم. این تلاش‌ها برایمان بسیار با ارزش بود. احساس می‌کردیم در حال ساختن ایرانی نو در پیرامون خود هستیم. گردهمآیی‌ها را در بالاخانه‌ای برگزار می‌کردیم. پیش از ورود، ایمنی خیابان را بررسی می‌کردیم. گردهمآیی هفتگی ما با  خواندن نیایش‌گونه‌ای به نام سرآغاز شروع و با پیمان‌نامه‌ای به نام هفت پیمان به پایان می‌رسید. بسیار پیش می‌آمد که من یکی از آن دو را با صدای رسا بخوانم. کوشش‌های هفته‌ی پیش را دوره می‌کردیم. آنگاه آژیر با ما به گفت‌وگو درباره‌ی ایران و فرهنگ آن می‌پرداخت. آژیر ملی‌گرا بود. نه ملی‌گرایی بر پایه‌ی کشورگشایی بلکه ملی‌گرایی بر پایه‌ی پاسداری از یگانگی سرزمینی و فرهنگ ملی. ملی‌گرایی بر پایه‌ی تاریخ و فرهنگ، بر پایه‌ی  گرامیداشت همه‌ی مردمان زمین و میهن‌ها و فرهنگ‌هایشان. این نخستین درسی بود که به ما آموخت: «حقیقت آنست که برای همگان پذیرفتنی باشد.» آموختیم که بنیاد شاهنشاهی ایران با یکپارچه کردن قوم‌ها و تیره‌های گوناگون به رهبری کوروش بزرگ در سال ۵۵۰ پیش از میلاد نهاده شد. بسیاری کوروش بزرگ را بنیانگذار حقوق بشر می‌دانند. او به مردمان آزادی داد که با زبان و دین خود زندگی کنند. و هرگاه بر سرزمینی نو می‌رسید، بردگان و اسیران را آزاد می‌کرد. در دنیای باستان، ایرانیان با نام \"آزاده\" شناخته می‌شدند، مردمان آزاد. در شاهنامه نیز به این نامگذاری اشاره شده است. منیژه بیژن را می‌بیند و به او دل می‌بندد. می‌پرسد آیا تو سیاوشی که زنده شده‌ای یا از پریزادگانی؟ پاسخ بیژن این است: سیاوش نیَم نَز پری‌زادگان   /   از ایرانم از شهر آزادگان. سخنان آژیر درباره‌ی بنیادهای فرهنگ ایرانیان دل و دیده‌ی ما را بر گذشته و آینده‌ی ایران می‌گشود، احساس می‌کردیم به رمز و رازهای ماندگاری آن دست یافته‌ایم. ایرانی ساخته شده بر پایه‌ی آرمان‌ها: راستی، نیکی و داد. ایرانی ساخته شده بر پایه‌ی آزادی. در یکی از واپسین گردهمآیی‌ها، تنی چند از دختران دانش‌آموز به ما پیوستند. در میان آنها دختری بود به نام پروانه، بسکتبال بازی می‌کرد؛ صدایی رسا و گیرا داشت. ایستادیم و در پایان گردهم‌آیی هفت پیمان را خواندیم. آخرین بند هفت پیمان از جان باختن به راه ایران می‌گوید",

  "text": "(8/54) “There’s only one way for love to begin in a traditional society. With the eyes. At the dinner table Mitra disagreed with everything I said. If I said ‘red,’ she said ‘green.’ If I said ‘spice,’ she said ‘sweet.’ But there was something between us. I could see it in the eyes. It was like glancing at a beautiful mountain from afar. The mountain hasn’t been experienced yet. Its cliffs have not been climbed. Its flowers have not been picked. But you are drawn to its beauty, even at a distance. On her fifteenth birthday I got her flowers. It was winter. There weren’t many flowers during winter. So I went to an Armenian flower shop and got fifteen white carnations, with one red in the center. I was shy with my words, so I wrote her a long letter. I told her the story of the female knight Gordafarid, one of the bravest champions in all of Shahnameh. Gordafarid was a master of archery. No bird could escape her arrows. And she was beautiful: her face glowed like the moon. Her waist was cypress-shaped. Her hair was worthy of a crown. I told Mitra: ‘She’s just like you. Together we can do great things for Iran!’ Mitra hid the letter from her father. One night over dinner I told him about my plans to become king. I told him that I would use my voice, and speak about 𝘋𝘢𝘢𝘥. Justice. He said: ‘This boy is delusional! He’s living in a thousand-year-old book!’ He told me that Iran was a constitutional monarchy. And unless I planned to lead a coup, the highest I could rise was Prime Minister. He said that Iranians were too worried about survival to care about ideals. So if I wanted to be Prime Minister, I’d need to put away childish ideas and learn about the real world. A few weeks later I joined a club of students at my school who met each week to discuss politics. It was the youth chapter of a new party called the Pan-Iranist Party. The leader of the club was a medical student from the University of Tehran. His name was Dr. Mohammadreza Ameli Tehrani. But everyone called him by his nickname: The Siren.” \n\nدر جامعه‌ی سنتی تنها یک راه برای ابراز دلبستگی هست. آن هم راه نگاه. سر میز شام میترا با هر آنچه می‌گفتم مخالفت می‌کرد. می‌گفتم سرخ، می گفت سبز. می‌گفتم تند، می گفت شیرین. ولی حسی میان ما‌ در حال شکفتن بود. می‌توانستم در دیدگانش ببینم. مانند تماشای کوهی در دوردست. کوهی که هنوز آزموده و پیموده نشده است. صخره‌هایش هنوز پیموده و گل‌هایش هنوز چیده نشده‌اند. ولی می‌شد از دور پیوندی گیرا را احساس کرد. در پانزدهمین زادروز میترا به او دسته‌ گلی‌ هدیه کردم. زمستان بود و در زمستان گل‌های زیادی یافت نمی‌شد. به یک گل‌فروشی ارمنی رفتم و پانزده گل میخک سفید و یک میخک سرخ در میان‌شان، خریدم. از سخن گفتن خجالت می‌کشیدم. از این رو نامه‌ی بلندی برایش ‌نوشتم. داستان زن پهلوانی را به نام گردآفرید برایش بازگفتم. گردآفرید از دلیرترین پهلوانان شاهنامه است. تیرانداز چیره‌دستی‌ست. هیچ پرنده‌ای را یارای رهایی از تیرش نیست. زیباست: رخسارش چون خورشید درخشان، سر و گیسوانش شایسته‌ و درخور تاج. رها شد ز بند زره موی او   /   درخشان چو خورشید شد روی او   /   بدانست سهراب کاو دختر است   /   سر و موی او از در افسر است. به میترا گفتم: «به راستی که مانند توست! همگام با هم می‌توانیم کارهای ارزشمندی برای ایران انجام دهیم.» میترا نامه را از پدرش پنهان کرد. شب‌هنگام آرزویم را برای شاه شدن با پدر میترا در میان گذاشتم. به او گفتم که سخنانم، صدای دادخواهی همه‌ی ایرانیان خواهد بود. گفت: «این پسر رؤیایی‌ست! او در کتابی هزارساله زندگی می‌کند!» به من گفت مگر آنکه نقشه‌ای برای کودتا داشته باشم وگرنه بالاترین جایگاهی که می‌توانم به آن دست یابم نخست وزیری‌ست. و ایرانیان بیش از آنکه در اندیشه‌ی آرمان‌ باشند، نگران زنده ماندنند. چنانچه بخواهم نخست‌وزیر شوم، باید خیال‌های کودکانه‌ را کنار بگذارم و به دنیای راستین بیندیشم. چند هفته پس از آن دیدار، به گروهی از دانش آموزان دبیرستان که گردهمایی سیاسی هفتگی داشتند پیوستم. این گروه شاخه‌ی جوانان حزب نوپایی بود که پان‌ایرانیست خوانده می‌شد. رهبر گروه، دانشجوی پزشکی دانشگاه تهران بود. نامش محمدرضا عاملی تهرانی. ولی همه او را با نام مستعارش صدا می‌زدند: آژیر",

  "text": "(7/54) ”In Shahnameh there’s one word that Rostam uses more than any other: 𝘋𝘢𝘢𝘥. Justice. 𝘋𝘢𝘢𝘥 is a simple concept. It means that everyone gets what they deserve: both good and bad. Everyone gets a fair share. The Nahavand of my childhood was very poor. People would come to our door each day asking for a single piece of bread. It seemed unjust to me. So I decided I would not eat more than that. My mother begged and begged, but I would not do it. I decided that if I became king, every child in Iran would be given their fair share. But until then I should participate in their suffering. I had no idea how I would become king. In Shahnameh it seemed so simple. Good kings glowed with light. Their wisdom was plain for all to see. I was an optimistic child. I felt that if I could use my voice, and speak about 𝘋𝘢𝘢𝘥 —then a path would open up before me.  When I turned fifteen I went to boarding school in Tehran. It was nothing like Shahnameh. Half a million people lived there, and it was a time of great upheaval. A huge debate was being held over the nationalization of oil. The streets were filled with voices of every kind, and nobody could agree on the future of Iran. I realized that many people didn’t want the same things that I wanted, and for complicated reasons. At the end of each week I’d go to the house of a relative to pick up my allowance. His wife was the first person in Iran to have a cooking show on the radio, so sometimes I’d stay for dinner. They had a young daughter named Mitra. Her hair was cut short in the style of a famous American actor. One of her hands was crippled by polio. She was very shy about it, but it was never something I noticed. Back then most Iranian girls were modest and deferential, but not Mitra. And she argued with everyone: her friends, the help, her family, and me. One night over dinner I started speaking about the past greatness of Iran: who we were. Back in the days of Shahnameh. When I finished talking, Mitra was the first to speak. She said: ‘You talk about Iran like it’s a lion. But it’s a cat.” That was the year I discovered something new. There are love stories in Shahnameh too.” \n\nواژه‌ای که رستم بیش از همه‌ی واژگان به کار می‌برد: داد است. عدالت. مفهومی‌ست ساده. بدین معنا که هر کس هر آنچه را شایسته‌اش هست، دریافت می‌کند. هم نیک و هم بد. رستم می‌گوید: جهان را همه سر به سر گشته‌ام   /   بسی شاه بیدادگر کُشته‌ام. فقر در نهاوند کودکی‌ام زیاد بود. هر روز می‌شد تنی چند به خانه‌مان بیایند و تکه نانی درخواست کنند. غمگین بودم. بر آن شدم که برای همدردی با آنان تکه نانی بیش نخورم. مادرم بارها خواهش کرد، ولی من خودداری می‌کردم. می‌اندیشیدم که اگر شاه بودم هر کودکی در ایران به سهم عادلانه‌ی خود می‌رسید. امروز تنها می‌توانم در رنج آنها شریک باشم. هیچ اندیشه‌ای درباره‌ی چگونگی پادشاه شدن نداشتم. در شاهنامه دنیا بسیار ساده به نظر می‌آمد. شاهان خوب در هاله‌ای از نور می‌درخشیدند. خردشان بر همه آشکار بود. من کودکی خوش‌بین بودم. بر آن بودم که اگر از عدالت بگویم، راهی پیش رویم باز خواهد شد. در پانزده‌سالگی، راهی مدرسه‌ی شبانه‌روزی البرز در تهران شدم. تهران شباهتی به شهرهای شاهنامه نداشت. نیم میلیون نفر در آنجا زندگی می‌کردند، و آن روزها هنگامه‌ی دگرگونی‌های بزرگ بود. کارزاری گسترده پیرامون ملی‌ کردن نفت در سراسر کشور برپا بود. خیابان‌ها پر بود از صداهای ملی‌ها، ملی‌گراها و کمونیست‌ها. روشنایی و تاریکی درهم آمیخته بودند. به دلایلی پیچیده بسیاری از مردم با آرمان‌های من همراه نبودند. پایان هر هفته، به خانه‌ی یکی از خویشان می‌رفتم تا کمک هزینه‌ی هفتگی‌ام را دریافت کنم. همسرش نخستین زنی بود که در ایران برنامه‌ی آموزش آشپزی رادیویی داشت، گاهی برای شام می‌ماندم. دختر نوجوانی داشتند به نام میترا. موهایش را مانند یک بازیگر مشهور آمریکایی کوتاه کرده بود. دست چپش به دلیل بیماری فلج اطفال اندکی ناکار بود. می‌کوشید آنرا بپوشاند. من آنرا نادیده می‌گرفتم، به نگاه من چیزی از ارزش‌های او نمی‌کاست.در آن زمان بیشتر دختران ایرانی سربه‌زیر و خجالتی بودند، ولی میترا اینگونه نبود. او با همه بحث می‌کرد: با دوستانش، با خدمتکاران، خانواده‌اش و من. شبی هنگام شام، از بزرگی‌های ایران باستان گفتم. و اینکه در روزگار شاهنامه چه بوده‌ایم. و چگونه می‌توانیم دوباره آن بزرگی‌ها را بازیابیم. پس از سخنانم، میترا پیش از همه چنین گفت: «تو از ایران به مانند شیری سخن می‌گویی. ولی ایران گربه‌ای بیش نیست.» در همان سال بود که حس تازه‌ای در من جان می‌گرفت. شاهنامه داستان‌های عاشقانه هم دارد",

  "text": "(6/54) “One New Year our whole family took a bus to Qom— one of the holiest cities in Iran. When we arrived in the city it was like stepping back in time. This was a different kind of Islam. It wasn’t my father’s. It wasn’t even my mother’s. It was an Islam from fourteen hundred years ago. The bookstores only stocked religious books. There were no radios, no music. My nine-year-old sister tried to buy some glass bracelets at the bazaar, but the shopkeeper wouldn’t serve her. Because she wasn’t wearing a hijab. When he turned his back I broke the bracelets against the table. In the afternoon I was given time to explore on my own. I remember I was wearing long pants. I’d never worn long pants before, so I felt like a man. I made my way to the biggest shrine in the city. There was a huge crowd for the holiday. As I pushed my way through, the crowd began to sway and move. People began to shout all around me. Hats were thrown in the air. I couldn’t see what was happening, even when I stood on the tips of my toes. But suddenly the crowd began to part. If I’d been one step further back, it would never have happened. But a path opened up in front of me. And there he was. I’d seen his portrait every day of my life on the inside cover of my Shahnameh: Mohammed Reza Shah. The king of Iran.  He was not yet the famous Shah that he’d one day become. At the time he was still a young man. But on that day he seemed to me like one of the great kings of Shahnameh. I was a shy child, but something came over me. I broke free from the crowd and began to follow him. He took off his shoes, I took off my shoes. He entered the shrine, I entered the shrine. This was my chance. I’d never been so close to a king. I knew I had to do something, so I reached out. And I touched his coat. I touched the coat of a king. That night when I came home I looked at myself in the mirror. Ferdowsi describes Rostam as having the height of a cypress. And arms that could rip rocks from the side of a cliff. I took one look at my scraggly body, and decided I was much too skinny to be a knight. But my garden was the best, it was plain for all to see. So I decided I would become the shah of Iran.”\n\nیک سال برای نوروز، همراه خانواده‌‌ با اتوبوس به قم رفتیم - یکی از دو شهر مهم مذهبی ایران. هنگامی که به قم رسیدیم، انگار به گذشته‌های دور بازگشته باشیم. گونه‌ی دیگری از اسلام بود. اسلام پدرم نبود. اسلام مادرم هم نبود. اسلام هزار و چند سد سال پیش بود. کتاب‌‌فروشی‌ها تنها کتاب‌های دینی داشتند. موسیقی نبود. خواهر کوچکم می‌خواست چند تا دستبند شیشه‌ای ارزان از بازار بخرد، ولی فروشنده از فروش به او خودداری کرد، چون حجاب نداشت. پس از اینکه فروشنده پشتش را به ما کرد دستبند را روی میز انداختم و شکست. بعد از ظهر آن روز اجازه گرفتم به تنهایی شهر را بگردم. به یاد دارم که شلوار بلند پوشیده بودم. پیش از این شلوار بلند نپوشیده بودم و‌ احساس مردانگی می‌کردم. راه حرم را پیش گرفتم. انبوه مردم برای تعطیلات نوروزی در حرم گرد آمده بودند. به دشواری وارد صحن شدم، ناگهان تکاپویی میان مردم افتاد، جا به جا شدند. دور و بری‌هایم هورا می‌کشیدند. کلاه‌هایی به هوا پرتاب می‌شد. روی نوک پاهایم ایستادم، در کلاس در شمار کوتاه‌قدها بودم، نمی‌توانستم ببینم چه رخ داده است. ناگهان مردم از هم جدا شدند. اگر تنها یک گام عقب‌تر می‌بودم چیزی برایم رخ نمی‌داد. مسیری در برابرم باز شد. او آنجا بود. چهره‌اش را هر روز در داخل جلد شاهنامه‌ام می‌دیدم: محمدرضا شاه پهلوی، پادشاه ایران از کنارم گذشت. هنوز شاه پرآوازه‌ای که در آینده شد، نبود. در آن هنگام او مردی جوان بود. ولی در آن روز او برایم مانند یکی از شاهان شاهنامه بود. من که همیشه کودکی خجالتی بودم، ناخودآگاه، در یک آن از جمعیت جدا شدم و او را دنبال کردم. کفش‌های خود را درآورد، من هم کفش‌هایم را درآوردم. وارد آستانه‌ی حرم شد، دنبالش کردم. کودک خجالتی برای دقیقه‌ای چند از پوسته‌ی همیشگی خود درآمده بود. می‌بایست کاری انجام می‌دادم که ارزش تعریف کردن داشته باشد، پس دستم را دراز کردم و پایین کتش را یکدم با دو انگشت گرفتم و رها کردم. سپس با شتاب به خانه برگشتم تا این پیشآمد را برای همه تعریف کنم. خود را در آینه نگاه کردم. فردوسی رستم را پیلتن می‌نامد، با چنگی که ‌سنگ خارا را موم می‌کند. اگر سنگ خارا به چنگ آیدش   /   شود موم و از موم ننگ آیدش. نگاهی به خود انداختم و دانستم که بسیار لاغرتر از آنم که بتوانم پهلوان شوم. ولی باغچه‌ام بهترین باغچه بود، زیبایی‌اش بر همگان آشکار. آرزوی شاه شدن برآوردنی‌تر می‌نمود",

  "text": "(5/54) “The meaning of our most important words I learned from my mother. 𝘙𝘢𝘴𝘵𝘪: Truth. I never heard her tell a lie. 𝘕𝘦𝘦𝘬𝘪: Goodness. I never heard her gossip. And 𝘔𝘦𝘩𝘳: Love. We were three brothers and five sisters, but she loved us all equally. There were no assigned places at our dinner table. Everyone got their desired portion. While we ate our father would encourage us to debate the events of the day. No topic was off limits: history, politics, even the existence of God. And everyone was encouraged to use their voice. One weekend my father drove us all to visit Ferdowsi’s tomb in the city of Tus. It’s a large tomb. It’s modeled after the tomb of Cyrus The Great. On its face is etched the first line of Shahnameh. The master verse. The cornerstone: ‘In the Name of the God of Soul and Wisdom.’ 𝘑𝘢𝘢𝘯 and 𝘒𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘥. Soul and Wisdom. The two things that all humans have. With the opening line Ferdowsi does away with all castes and classes. He does away with all religion. He gives everyone a direct connection to the creator. As a young boy I’d memorized hundreds of verses. One of my favorite stories in Shahnameh is when Rostam selects his horse. Rakhsh is the only horse in Iran that can carry Rostam’s weight. Rakhsh has the body of a mammoth. But he's wild, he foams at the mouth. Rostam has to fight to tame him. I was a shy child. But something happens when I read Shahnameh. There’s an epic cadence. The words demand to be spoken.  It’s like touching a hot stove. I feel the heat, I feel the pressure. It’s like a sword pierces my body and I have to let it out: ‘𝘙𝘢𝘬𝘩𝘴𝘩 𝘳𝘰𝘢𝘳𝘦𝘥 𝘣𝘦𝘯𝘦𝘢𝘵𝘩 𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘮!’ The neighbors would come running to their balconies to watch. Every region in Iran has its own dialect, and I could switch between them. The language is ancient, so I didn’t know the meaning of every word. But I could feel the music. When I mispronounced a word, I knew. As if I’d played a wrong chord. I could almost tell what he wanted. I could almost hear the voice of Ferdowsi himself.”\n\nمعنای مهم‌ترین واژگان زبان‌مان را از مادرم آموختم، راستی، هرگز دروغی از او‌ نشنیدم. نیکی، هرگز غیبت نمی‌کرد و مهر و دوستی. ما سه برادر و پنج خواهر بودیم و مادر همه را به اندازه‌ی مساوی دوست داشت. برای هیچکس جایگاه ویژه‌ای بر سر سفره در نظر گرفته نمی‌شد. هر کسی به میل و اندازه‌ی خود از خوراک سهم می‌برد. هنگام خوردن پدر تشویق‌مان می‌کرد که درباره‌ی رویدادهای روز گفت‌وگو کنیم. هیچ موضوعی قدغن نبود: تاریخ، سیاست، حتا وجود خداوند. و همه تشویق می‌شدند که اندیشه‌های خود را بیان کنند. پدر ما را یک هفته به دیدن آرامگاه فردوسی در شهر توس برد. آرامگاهی بود بزرگ. بسان آرامگاه کوروش بزرگ طراحی شده است. نخستین بیت شاهنامه بر روی سنگ آرامگاه حک شده بود. شاه‌بیت است. پایه‌ و ستون اندیشه‌ و جهان‌بینی ایرانی‌ست: به نام خداوند جان و خرد. دو چیزی که همه‌ی مردمان از آن برخوردارند. در نخستین برگ شاهنامه، فردوسی همه‌ی طبقات اجتماعی را کنار می‌نهد. همه‌ی دین‌ها را کنار می‌نهد. فردوسی به مردمان پیوندی بی‌واسطه با خداوند می‌بخشد. او می‌گوید: هر آنچه در این کتاب است، برای همگان است. در کودکی سد‌ها بیت شاهنامه را به یاد سپرده بودم. از داستان‌های مورد علاقه‌ام در شاهنامه جایی‌ست که رستم اسبش، رخش را برمی‌گزیند. رخش تنها اسبی‌ست در ایران که می‌تواند رستم و جنگ افزار سنگینش را تاب بیاورد. رخش تنی بسان پیل دارد. سرکش است، رستم برای گرفتن و رام کردنش می‌بایست سخت بکوشد. من کودکی خجالتی بودم. ولی زمانی که شاهنامه را می‌خواندم، شور شگفت‌انگیزی مرا فرا می‌گرفت. شعرها آهنگی رزمی دارند. واژگان خواستار خوانش‌اند. همانند دست زدن به کوره‌ای گرم. گرما را حس می‌کنم، فشار را حس می‌کنم. همانند شمشیری که تنم را می‌شکافد و باید آن را فریاد بزنم: از این سو خُروشی برآورد رَخش   /   وزآن سوی اسب یل تاجبخش. همسایگان شتابان بر روی بام‌هاشان جمع می‌شدند تا شنونده‌ی فردوسی باشند. هر منطقه‌ای از ایران گویش و لهجه‌ی خود را دارد. من داستان‌های شاهنامه را به فارسی و گویش‌های محلی‌مان می‌خواندم. کتاب به زبان پارسی کهن سروده شده است‌، معنای همه‌ی واژگان را نمی‌دانستم ولی آهنگش را حس می‌کردم. اگر واژه‌ای را اشتباه می‌خواندم، درمی‌یافتم. چنانکه گویی نُت موسیقی را اشتباه زده‌ باشی. می‌توانستم به درستی بدانم که او چه می‌خواهد بگوید. گویی صدای دلآویز فردوسی را  به جان می‌شنیدم",
